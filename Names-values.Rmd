# Names and values {#names-values}

```{r, include = FALSE}

}
```

## Introduction

Understanding the distinction between names and values is critical.

An improved mental will help you better predict performance and memory usage of R code. It can even help you write faster code because accidental copies are a major cause of slow code.

It will also help you better understand R's functional programming tools.

Along the way, you'll learn about some common myths, such as that you need to call `gc()` to free up memory, or that `for` loops are always slow.

<!-- FIXME: cite R-exts and R-ints formally -->

The details of R's memory management are not documented in a single place. Most of the information in this chapter was gleaned from a close reading of the documentation (particularly `?Memory` and `?gc`), the [memory profiling](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Profiling-R-code-for-memory-use) section of R-exts, and the [SEXPs](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html#SEXPs) section of R-ints. The rest I figured out by reading the C source code, performing small experiments, and asking questions on R-devel. Any mistakes are entirely mine.

## Binding basics
\index{bindings} \index{assignment}

It's easy to read this code as: "create an object named 'x', containing the values 1, 2, and 3". 

```{r}
x <- 1:3
```

But that's a simplification that will lead to you make inaccurate predictions about what R is actually doing behind the scenes. It's more accurate to think about this code as doing to values 

* Creating the object, the values, `1:3`.
* Binding the object to a name, `x`.

In R, objects in R don't have names; instead names have objects. To make that distinction more clear, we'll use a diagram like this: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/binding-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

The name, `x`, is drawn with a rounded rectangle, and the value, the vector `1:3` is drawn in the same style as the previous chapter. Also note the direction of the arrow: it points in the opposite direction to the assigment arrow. `<-` creates a binding from the name on the left-hand side to the object on the right-hand side.

You can think of a name as a reference to a value. For example, if you run this code, we don't get another copy of the value `1:3`, we get another binding to the existing object:

```{r}
y <- x
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/binding-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

You might have noticed the value `1:3` has a label: `0x74b`. While R doesn't give the vector a name, for the purpose of communication between humans, I need to. These unique identifers have a special form that look like the object's memory "address". You can access the address of an object with `lobstr::obj_addr()`, which allows you to use  The following code verifies that `x` and `y` both point to the same location in memory.

```{r}
obj_addr(x)
obj_addr(y)
```

It takes some time to get your head around the distinction between names and values, but it's really helpful for functional programming when you start to work with functions that have different names in different contexts.

### Non-syntactic names
\index{reserved names} \indexc{`} \index{non-syntactic names}

You've probably used regular assignment in R thousands of times. Regular assignment creates a binding between a name and an object in the current environment. Names usually consist of letters, digits, `.` and `_`, and can't begin with `_`.  If you try to use a name that doesn't follow these rules, you get an error:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
_abc <- 1
# Error: unexpected input in "_"
```

Reserved words (like `TRUE`, `NULL`, `if`, and `function`) follow the rules but are reserved by R for other purposes. A complete list of reserved words can be found in `?Reserved`.It's possible to override the usual rules and use a name with any sequence of characters by surrounding the name with backticks:

```{r}
`:)` <- "smile"
`:)`
```

Typically the use of backticks is most important when you are accessing the name of a column in a data frame from a weird datasource.

::: sidebar
You can also create non-syntactic bindings using single and double quotes (i.e. `"a + b" <- 3`) instead of backticks, but I don't recommend it. The ability to use strings on the left hand side of the assignment arrow is a historical artefact, used before R supported backticks.
:::



## Copy-on-modify

What happens if we modify `y`? `x` doesn't also change:

```{r}
y[[3]] <- 4
x
```

That's because most objects are __immutable__. While the value associated with `y` change, the original object does not. Instead, R creates a new object, `0xcd2`, a copy of `0x74b` with one value changed, then rebinds `y` to that object.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/binding-3.png", dpi = 300)
```

This behaviour is called __copy-on-modify__, and understanding it makes your intuition for the performance of R code radically better.

You can see when an object gets copied with `base::tracemem()`. You give it a name that binds an object, and it will tell you every time that object gets copied:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
cat(tracemem(x))

y <- x
y[[3]] <- 4L

y[[3]] <- 5L
```

Note that if you modify `y` again, it doesn't get copied. That's because the new object now only has a single name binding it, so R can apply a modify-in-place optimisation. We'll come back to that shortly.

### Functional calls

The same rules for copying also apply to function calls. Take this code:

```{r}
f <- function(a) {
  a
}
x <- 1:3
z <- f(x)
```

While `f()` is running, `a` inside the function will point to the same value as `x` does outside of it:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/binding-f1.png", dpi = 300)
```

(You'll learn more about the conventions used in this digram in [Execution environments].)

And once complete, `z` will point to the same object.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/binding-f2.png", dpi = 300)
```

`0x74b` never gets copied because it never gets modified. If `f()` did modify `x`, R would create a new copy, and then `z` would bind that object. 

### Lists

It's not just names (i.e. variables) that point to values. Lists do too. Take this list, which superficially is very similar to the vector above:

```{r}
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
```

The internal representation of the list is actually quite different to that of a vector. A list is really a vector of references:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/list.png", dpi = 300)
```

This is particularly important when we modify a list:

```{r}
l2 <- l1
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/l-modify-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
l2[[3]] <- 4
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/l-modify-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

Like vectors, lists are immutable; the original list is left unchanged, and R creates a modified copy. Note that the copy is __shallow__: only the list object is copied (and modified), the individual elements are not. This has a big impact on performance.

### Object size
\indexc{object\_size} \indexc{obj\_size}

Since the elements of lists are references to values, the size of a list might be much smaller than you expect:

```{r}
x <- 1:1e6
obj_size(x)

y <- list(x, x, x)
obj_size(y)
```

`y` is only 72 bytes[^32bit] bigger than `x`. That's the size of an empty list:

```{r}
obj_size(list(NULL, NULL, NULL))
```

[^32bit]: If you're runnning 32-bit R you'll see slightly different sizes.

::: base
We need to use `lobstr::obj_size()` here because the base equivalent, `utils::object.size()`, incorrectly counts `x` three times when computing the size of `y`.
:::

References also make it challenging to think about the sizes of individual objects. `obj_size(x) + obj_size(y)` will only equal `obj_size(x, y)` if there are no shared values. Here, the combined size of `x` and `y` is the same as the size of `y`:

```{r}
obj_size(x, y)
```

### Data frames

Data frames are lists, so this behaviour has important consequences when you modify a data frame. Take this data frame:

```{r}
d1 <- data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 6), y = c(2, 4, 3))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/dataframe.png", dpi = 300)
```

If you modify a column, only that column needs to be modified; the others can continue to point to the same place:

```{r}
d2 <- d1
d2[, 2] <- d2[, 2] * 2
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/d-modify-c.png", dpi = 300)
```

However, if you modify a row, there is no way to share data with the previous version of the data frame.

```{r}
d3 <- d1
d3[1, ] <- d3[1, ] * 2
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/d-modify-r.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Character vectors
\index{string pool}

The final place that R uses references is in character vectors. In the previous chapter, we drew character vectors like this:

```{r}
x <- c("a", "a", "abc", "d")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/character.png", dpi = 300)
```

But this is a bit of a simplification because R has a __global string pool__. Each element of a character vector is actually a pointer to a unique string in that pool:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/character-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

This means that character vectors take up less memory than you might expect: repeating a string 100 times does not make it take up 100 times as much memory.

```{r}
banana <- "bananas bananas bananas"
obj_size(banana)
obj_size(rep(banana, 100))
```

Generally, however, this detail is not important, so elsewhere in the book I'll draw character vectors as if the individual strings live inside the vector.

### Replacement bindings

```{r}
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
names(x)
names(x)[2] <- "two"
names(x)
```

This works because the expression `names(x)[2] <- "two"` is evaluated as if you had written:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
`*tmp*` <- names(x)
`*tmp*`[2] <- "two"
names(x) <- `*tmp*`
```

(Yes, it really does create a local variable named `*tmp*`, which is removed afterwards.)


## Modify-in-place

### Environments {#env-modify}

There are two exceptions to the copy-on-modify rule. The first is environments, which you'll learn more in [Environments]. Environments have reference semantics which means that they are modified in place. Take this environment, which we bind to `e1` and `e2`:

```{r}
e1 <- rlang::env(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
e2 <- e1
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/e-modify-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

If we modify one reference, the environment is modified in place:

```{r}
e1$c <- 4
e2$d
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/e-modify-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

One consequence of this is that environments can contain themselves:

```{r}
e <- rlang::env()
e$self <- e
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/e-self.png", dpi = 300)
```

This is a unique property of environments!

### Objects with a single binding

The second exception to the copy-on-modify rule applies to any object that has only single binding. I think it's best to think of this as a performance optimisation; if an object only has one name that points to it, then this has the same behaviour as copy-on-modify, but is obviously much faster.

```{r}
v <- 1:3
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/v-inplace-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
v[[3]] <- 4L
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/v-inplace-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

(Carefully note the object ids here: `0x207` is modified in place.)

It's challenging to predict exactly when R applies this optimisation because of two complications:

* When it comes to bindings, R can currently[^refcnt] only count 0, 1, 
  and many. 
  
* As described above, any regular function call makes a binding to its
  argument. The only exception are specially written C functions, which
  occur mostly in the base package.

[^refcnt]: By the time you read this, that may have changed, as plans are afoot to improve reference counting: https://developer.r-project.org/Refcnt.html

Because the rules are complex, it's not usually worthwhile to predict whether or not a copy will occur. Instead determine empirically by using `tracemem()`. 

For loops in R have a reputation for being slow. Often that slowness is because you're modifying a copy instead of modifying in place. Consider the following code. It subtracts the median from each column of a large data frame: \index{loops!avoiding copies}

```{r, cache = TRUE}
x <- data.frame(matrix(runif(5 * 1e4), ncol = 5))
medians <- vapply(x, median, numeric(1))

for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
  x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
```

You may be surprised to realise that every iteration of the loop copies the data frame. We can see that more clearly by using `tracemem()`:

```{r}
cat(tracemem(x))
for (i in 1:5) {
  x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}

untracemem(x)
```

And in fact, each iteration copies the data frame not once, not twice, but three times! We get two copies because of how `[[.data.frame` is implemented, and we get one copy because `[[.data.frame` is a regular function and hences increments the reference count. I think these copies will be shallow so they are not too expensive, but it obviously adds overhead.

We can make the function substantially more efficient by using a list instead of a data frame. Modifying a list uses internal C code, so the refs are not incremented and only a single copy is made.

```{r}
y <- as.list(x)
cat(tracemem(y))

for (i in 1:5) {
  y[[i]] <- y[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
```

While determining that copies are being made is not hard, preventing such behaviour is. If you find yourself resorting to exotic tricks to avoid copies, it may be time to rewrite your function in C++, as described in [Rcpp](#rcpp).

### Exercises

1.  Explain why `tracemem()` records two copies when you run this code.
    Hint: carefully look at the difference between this code and the code 
    earlier in the section.
     
    ```{r, results = FALSE}
    x <- 1:3
    tracemem(x)
    
    x[[3]] <- 4
    ```

## Unbinding and the garbage collector {#gc}

Consider this code:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/unbinding-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
x <- 2:4
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/unbinding-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
rm(x)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/name-value/unbinding-3.png", dpi = 300)
```

We create two objects, but by the end of code neither object is bound to a name. How do these values get deleted? That's the job of the __garbage collector__. It walks through every object in memory and counting how many references it has. If there are no references, the object is deleted. We'll come back to this in more detail below.

### When does the garbage collector run?

Despite what you might have read elsewhere, there's never any need to call `gc()` yourself. R will automatically run garbage collection whenever it needs more space; if you want to see when that is, call `gcinfo(TRUE)`. The only reason you _might_ want to call `gc()` is to ask R to return memory to the operating system. However, even that might not have any effect: older versions of Windows had no way for a program to return memory to the OS. \indexc{gc()}

### Memory usage

While `obj_size()` tells you the size of a single object, `pryr::mem_used()` tells you the total size of all objects in memory: \indexc{mem\_used()}

```{r}
pryr::mem_used()
```

This number won't agree with the amount of memory reported by your operating system for a number of reasons:

1. It only includes objects created by R, not the R interpreter itself.

1. Both R and the operating system are lazy: they won't reclaim memory 
   until it's actually needed. R might be holding on to memory because 
   the OS hasn't yet asked for it back.

1. R counts the memory occupied by objects but there may be gaps due to 
   deleted objects. This problem is known as memory fragmentation.

### Memory change

`mem_change()` builds on top of `mem_used()` to tell you how memory changes during code execution. Positive numbers represent an increase in the memory used by R, and negative numbers represent a decrease. \indexc{mem\_change()}

```{r}
# Need about 4 mb to store 1 million integers
pryr::mem_change(x <- 1:1e6)
# We get that memory back when we delete it
pryr::mem_change(rm(x))
```

Even operations that don't do anything use up a little memory. This is because R is tracking the history of everything you do. You can ignore anything smaller than a couple kB.

```{r}
pryr::mem_change(NULL)
pryr::mem_change(NULL)
```

In some languages, you have to explicitly delete unused objects for their memory to be returned. R uses an alternative approach: garbage collection (or GC for short). GC automatically releases memory when an object is no longer used. It does this by tracking how many names point to each object, and when there are no names pointing to an object, it deletes that object. \index{garbage collection}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
rm(y)
```

```{r}
# Create a big object
pryr::mem_change(x <- 1:1e6)
# Also point to 1:1e6 from y
pryr::mem_change(y <- x)
# Remove x, no memory freed because y is still pointing to it
pryr::mem_change(rm(x))
# Now nothing points to it and the memory can be freed
pryr::mem_change(rm(y))
```

### Memory leaks

GC takes care of releasing objects that are no longer used. However, you do need to be aware of possible memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when you keep pointing to an object without realising it. In R, the two main causes of memory leaks are formulas and closures because they both capture the enclosing environment. The following code illustrates the problem. In `f1()`, `1:1e6` is only referenced inside the function, so when the function completes the memory is returned and the net memory change is 0. `f2()` and `f3()` both return objects that capture environments, so that `x` is not freed when the function completes. \index{memory!leaks}

```{r}
f1 <- function() {
  x <- 1:1e6
  10
}
pryr::mem_change(x <- f1())
obj_size(x)

f2 <- function() {
  x <- 1:1e6
  a ~ b
}
pryr::mem_change(y <- f2())
obj_size(y)

f3 <- function() {
  x <- 1:1e6
  function() 10
}
pryr::mem_change(z <- f3())
obj_size(z)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
rm(y, z)
```
