## Introduction

Now that you understand the tree structure of R code, it's time to come back to one of the fundamental ideas that make `expr()` and `ast()` work: __quasiquotation__.  There are two sides to quasiquotation:

* __Quotation__ allows the _developer_ to capture the AST associated with a 
  function argument without evaluating it.
  
* __Unquotation__ allows the _user_ to selectively evaluate parts of an 
  expression that would otherwise be captured.

The combination of these two ideas makes it easy to compose expressions that are mixtures of direct and indirect specification, and helps to solve a wide variety of challenging problems. 

In this chapter, we'll ...

Quoting functions have deep connections to Lisp __macros__. However, macros are run at compile-time, which doesn't have any meaning in R, and always return expressions. To learn more about macros in R, see @lumley-2001. They're also somewhat like Lisp [__fexprs__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fexpr), functions where all arguments are quoted by default. These terms are useful to know when looking for related techniques in other programming languages. \index{macros} \index{fexprs}

```{r}
if (packageVersion("rlang") < "0.1.6.9000") {
  cat("Chapter currently relies on development version of rlang")
}
```

### Motivation

We'll start with a simple and concrete example that helps motivate the need for unquoting, and hence quasiquotation. Imagine you're creating a lot of strings by joining together words:

```{r}
paste("Good", "morning", "Hadley")
paste("Good", "afternoon", "Alice")
```

You are sick and tired of writing all those quotes, and instead you just want to use bare words. To that end, you've managed to write the following function:

```{r}
cement <- function(...) {
  exprs(...) %>% 
    map(expr_name) %>% 
    paste(collapse = " ")
}

cement(Good, morning, Hadley)
cement(Good, afternoon, Alice)
```

(We'll talk about the details of this implementation later; for now just look at the results.)

Formally, this function __quotes__ the arguments in `...`; and you can think of it as automatically putting quotation marks around each argument. (That's not precisely true as the intermediate objects it generates are expressions, not strings, but it's a useful approximation.) 

This is nice because we no longer need to type quotes. The problem, however, comes when we want to use variables. It's easy to use variables with `paste()` as we just don't surround them with quotes:

```{r}
name <- "Hadley"
time <- "morning"

paste("Good", time, name)
```

Obviously this doesn't work with `cement()` because every input is automatically quoted:

```{r}
cement(Good, time, name)
```

We need some way to explicitly __unquote__ the input, to tell `cement()` to remove the quote marks that it adds automatically. Here we need `time` and `name` to be treated differently to `Good`. Quasiquotation give us a standard tool to do so: `!!`, prounounced bang-bang. `!!` tells a quoting function to drop the implicit quotes:

```{r}
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

It's useful to compare `cement()` and `paste()` directly. `paste()` evaluates its arguments, so we need to quote where needed; `cement()` quotes its arguments, so we need to unquote where needed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
paste("Good", time, name)
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

### Theory

Now that you've seen the basic idea, it's time to talk a little bit about the theory. The idea of quasiquotation is an old one. It was first developed by a philsopher, Willard van Orman Quine[^1], in the early 1940s. It's needed in philosophy because it helps to be precise between the use and mention of words, i.e. between the object and the words we use to refer to that object. Quasiquotation was first used in a programming language, LISP, in the mid-1970s [@bawden-1999], and has been implemented in most languages from that heritage such as racket (with `` ` `` and `@`), clojure (`` ` `` and `~`), and julia (`:` and `@`). 

[^1]: You might be familiar with the name Quine from "quines", computer programs that when run return a copy of their own source code.

Quasiquotation has only recently been implemented in R. Despite it's newness, I teach it in this book because it is a rich and powerful theory that makes many hard problems much easier. Quaisquotation in R is a little different to other languages because many functions provide quasiquotation, where in LISP and descendents there is typically only one function that does quasiquotation (the quote function), and you must call it explicitly when needed. This makes these languages less ambiguous (because there's a clear signal in the code that something odd is happening), but is less appropriate for R because quasiquotation is such an important part of DSLs for data analysis.

## Quotation

Quotation allows you to capture an AST without evaluating it. We'll discuss two sets of tools: those provided by rlang, and those provided by base R.

### With rlang

For interactive exploration, the most important quoting function is `expr()`. It returns its argument exactly as given:

```{r}
expr(x + y)
expr(1 / 2 / 3)
```

`expr()` is great for interactive exploration, but it's not useful inside a function, because it always returns exactly what it's called with:

```{r}
f <- function(x) expr(x)
f(x + y + z)
```

Instead, you need to use `enexpr()`. This takes the internal promise object that powers lazy evaluation in R and extracts the expression that was passed to the function:

```{r}
f <- function(x) enexpr(x)
f(x + y + z)
```

(Occassionaly you just want to capture symbols, and throw an error for other types of input. In that case you can use `ensym()`. In the next chapter, you'll learn about `enquo()` which also captures the environment and is needed for tidy evaluation.)

If you need to capture all arguments in `...` use `exprs()`:

```{r}
f <- function(...) exprs(...)
f(x = 1, y = 10 * z)
```

You can also use `exprs()` interactively if you want to make a list of expressions:

```{r}
exprs(x = x ^ 2, y = y ^ 3, z = z ^ 4)
# shorthand for
# list(x = expr(x ^ 2), y = expr(y ^ 3), z = expr(z ^ 4))
```

There's not much you can do with a list of expressions yet, but we'll see a few techniques later in [case studies](quasi-case-studies): using purrr to work with list of expressions turns out to be a surprisingly powerful tool.

### With base R

The base equivalent of `expr()` is `quote()`:
  
```{r}
quote(x + y)
quote(1 / 2 / 3)
```

It is identical to `expr()` except that does not support unquoting, so it a quoting function, not a quasiquoting function.

The base function closest to `enexpr()` is `substitute()`:

```{r}
f <- function(x) substitute(x)
f(x + y + z)
```

You'll most often see if used to capture unevaluated arguments, and is often in concert with `deparse()` to create labels for output. However, `substitute()` also does "substitution": if you give it an expression, rather than a symbol, it will substitute in values of symbols defined in the current environment. 

```{r}
f2 <- function(x) substitute(x * 2)
f2(x + y + z)
```

`substitute()` provides a sort of automatic unquoting for any symbol that is bound to a value. However, making use of this behaviour can make for hard to read code, because for example, taken out of context, you can't tell if the goal `substitute(x + y)` is to substitute in `x`, or, `y`, or both. If you do want to use `substitute()` in this way, I recomend that you use the 2nd argument to be explicit:

```{r}
substitute(x * y * z, list(x = 10, y = quote(a + b)))
```

There is no base equivalent to `exprs()` but you could write your own:
  
```{r}
dots <- function(...) match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)$`...`
dots(x = 1, y = x + 2)
```

This takes advantage of another function that quotes the entire call to the function, not just individual arguments: `match.call()`. You'll see `match.call()` frequently used in modelling functions as way of capturing the complete model specification so that it can be printed in labels.

```{r}
mod <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
mod$call
```

We'll come back to `match.call()` in the next chapter; unfortunately its semantics means that you must be very careful when using it for anything other than labelling.

There are two other important quoting functions in base R that we'll cover in depth elsewhere. `bquote()` provides a limited form of quasiquotation, and is discussed in [unquoting with base R](#unquote-base). `~`, the formula, is a quoting function that also captures the environment. It's the inspiration for quosures, and is discussed in [Formulas].

### Exercises

1.  What does the following command return? Why is information lost?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    expr({
      x +              y # comment  
    })
    ```

1.  The documentation for `substitute()` says:

    > Substitution takes place by examining each component of the parse tree 
    > as follows: If it is not a bound symbol in env, it is unchanged. If it
    > is a promise object, i.e., a formal argument to a function or explicitly 
    created using delayedAssign(), the expression slot of the promise replaces 
    > the symbol. If it is an ordinary variable, its value is substituted, 
    > unless env is .GlobalEnv in which case the symbol is left unchanged.
    
    Create four examples that illustrate each of the different cases.

1.  Why does `as.Date.default()` use `substitute()` and `deparse()`?
    Why does `pairwise.t.test()` use them? Read the source code.

1.  `pairwise.t.test()` assumes that `deparse()` always returns a length one 
    character vector. Can you construct an input that violates this expectation? 
    What happens?


## Evaluation

Typically you have quoted a function argument for one of two reasons:

* You want to operate on the AST using the techniques described in the
  previous chapter.
  
* You want to run, or __evaluate__ the code in a special context,
  as described in depth next chapter.

The most important function for evaluation is `base::eval()`. The first argument to `eval()` is the expression to evalute:

```{r}
ru5 <- expr(runif(5))
ru5

eval(ru5)
eval(ru5)
```

Note that every time we evaluate this expression we get a different result.

The second argument to `eval()` is the environment in which the expression is evaluated. Manipulating this environment allows is a powerful idea that underlies tools like dplyr, and is the subject of the next chapter.

```{r}
x <- 9
fx <- expr(f(x))

eval(fx, env(f = function(x) x * 10))
eval(fx, env(f = function(x) x ^ 2))
```

## Unquotation

Evaluation is a developer tool: in combination with quoting, it allows the author of a function to capture an argument and evaluate it in a special way. Unquoting is related to evaluation, but it's more of a user tool. It allows the person calling the function to selectely evaluate parts of the expresion that would otherwise be quoted. Another way of thinking about unquoting is that it provides a code template: you define an AST with some "holes" that get filled in using unquoting. 

### With rlang

All quoting functions in rlang (`enexpr()`, `ensym()`, `enquo()` and friends) supporting unquoting with `!!` (called unquote, and pronounced bang-bang) and `!!!` (called unquote-splice, and pronounced bang-bang-bang). They both replace nodes in the AST. `!!` is a one-to-one replacement. It takes a single expression and inlines the AST at the location of the `!!`. 

```{r}
x <- expr(a + b + c)
expr(f(!!x, y))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

`!!!` is a one-to-many replacement. It takes a list of expressions and inserts them at them at the location of the `!!!`:

```{r}
x <- exprs(1, 2, 3, y = 10)
expr(f(!!!x, z = z))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

### With base R {#unquote-base}

Base R has one function that implements a form of quasiquotation: `bquote()`. It uses `.()` for unquoting, and does not support unquoting-splicing. 

```{r}
xyz <- expr((x + y + z))
bquote(- .(xyz) / 2)
```

`bquote()` is not used to provide quasiquotation for any other function in R so functions that quote an arugment must use some other technique to allow indirect specification. There are four basic forms seen in base R:

```{r, include = FALSE}
call <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "match.call"))
subs <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "substitute"))
eval <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "eval"))

intersect(subs, eval)
```

*   A pair of quoting and non-quoting functions. For example, `$` has two 
    arguments, and the second argument is quoted. This is easier to see if you 
    write in prefix form: `mtcars$cyl` is equivalent to `` `$`(mtcars, cyl) ``. 
    If you want to refer to a variable indirectly, you use `[[`, as it 
    takes the name of a variable as a string.
      
    ```{r}
    x <- list(var = 1, y = 2)
    var <- "y"
    
    x$var
    x[[var]]
    ```
  
    `<-`/`assign()` and `::`/`getExportedValue()` work similarly.

*   A pair of quoting and non-quoting arguments. For example, `data()`, `rm()`, 
    and `save()` allow you to provide bare variable names in `...`, or a 
    character vector of variable names in `list`.

    ```{r}
    x <- 1
    rm(x)

    y <- 2
    vars <- c("y", "vars")
    rm(list = vars)
    ```

*   An argument that controls whether a different argument is quoting or 
    non-quoting. For example, in `library()`, the `character.only` argument
    controls the quoting behaviour of of the first argument, `package`:
    
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(MASS)
    
    pkg <- "MASS"
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
    ```
    
    `demo()`, `detach()`, `example()`, and `require()` work similarly.

*   Quoting if evaluation fails. For example, the first argument to `help()`
    is non-quoting if it's an existing variable name (that points to a string);
    otherwise it is quoting. 
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Shows help for var
    help(var)
    
    var <- "mean"
    # Shows help for mean
    help(var)
    
    var <- 10
    # Shows help for var
    help(var)
    ```
    
    `ls()`, `page()`, and `match.fun()` work similarly. 

Some quoting functions, like `subset()`, `transform()`, and `with()`, don't have a non-quoting form. This is because they are primarily wrappers around `[` and `[<-`. 

Another important class of quoting functions are base modelling and plotting functions, which quote some of their arguments. For `lm()` quotes the `weight` and `subset` arguments, and when used with a formula argument, the plotting function quote the aesthetic arguments (`col`, `cex`, etc):

```{r}
palette(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1"))
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris, col = Species, pch = 20, cex = 2)
```

These functions follow the so-called standard non-standard evaluation rules: <http://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf>. 

### Non-standard ASTs

Using unquoting, it is possible to create non-standard ASTs, i.e. ASTs that contain components that are not constants, symbols, or calls. These are valid, and occassionally useful, but it's most important to understand what's going on because R's default print method does not always accurately reflect the underlying tree. For example, R will display integer sequences as if they were generated with `:`.

```{r}
x2 <- expr(f(!!c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L)))
x2
lobstr::ast(!!x2)
```

And if you inline more complex objects, their attributes are not printed which might lead to confusing output:

```{r}
x3 <- expr(class(!!data.frame(x = 10)))
x3
eval(x3)
```

Finally, R will print parentheses that don't exist in the call tree:

```{r}
y1 <- expr(2 + 3)
x1 <- expr(1 + !!y1)
x1
lobstr::ast(!!x1)
```

In general, if you're ever confused about what is actually in an AST, display the object with `ast()`!

### The polite fiction of `!!`

So far we have pretended that `!!` and `!!!` are real prefix operators like `+` , `-`, and `!`: they're not. rlang enforces the polite fiction to make life easier, but from R's perspective `!!` is not a single syntactic entity but simply two `!` next to each other:

```{r}
!!TRUE
```

rlang chose `!!` and `!!!` for unquoting because they're clear visual symbol that something different is going on, and it's very rare to need double or triple negative as part of idiomatic R code. 

The polite fiction runs deeps, and includes giving `!!` and `!!!` precedence similar to `+` and `-`, rather than to `!`. The operator precedence for `!` is suprisingly low: it has lower precedence that than of the binary algebraic and logical operators. Most of the time this doesn't matter as it is unusual to mix `!` and binary operators (e.g. `!x + y` or !x > y`). Expressions like `!!x + !!y` are not uncommon when unquoting, and requring `(!!x) + (!!y)` feels onerous (and introduces spurious parentheses into the AST). For this reason, rlang manipulates the AST to give the unquoting operators a more natural precedence.

(If for some reason you do need to doubly negate a value in a quasiquoting function, just add a pair of parentheses `!(!x)`.)

### Exercises

1.  Base functions `match.fun()`, `page()`, and `ls()` all try to
    automatically determine whether you want standard or non-standard
    evaluation. Each uses a different approach. Figure out the essence
    of each approach then compare and contrast.

1.  The following two calls print the same, but are actually different:

    ```{r}
    (a <- expr(mean(1:10)))
    (b <- expr(mean(!!(1:10))))
    identical(a, b)
    ```

    What's the difference? Which one is more natural?

## Case studies {#quasi-case-studies}

### Calling quoting functions

One downside of non-standard evaluation 

A function is __referentially transparent__ if you can replace its arguments with their values and its behaviour doesn't change. For example, if a function, `f()`, is referentially transparent and both `x` and `y` are 10, then `f(x)`, `f(y)`, and `f(10)` will all return the same result. This is clearly not 

```{r}
x <- runif(5)

(exp(2 * x) - exp(-2 * x)) / (exp(2 * x) + exp(-2 * x))

y <- 2*x
(exp(y) - exp(-y)) / (exp(y) + exp(-y))

sinh_y <- (exp(y) - exp(-y)) / 2
cosh_y <- (exp(y) + exp(-y)) / 2
sinh_y / cosh_y
```

The biggest downside of NSE is that functions that use it are no longer [referentially transparent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)). If you want to call a quoting function inside another function you need to quote and unquote.

```{r}
expr((exp(2 * x) - exp(-2 * x)) / (exp(2 * x) + exp(-2 * x)))

y <- 2 * x
expr((exp(y) - exp(-y)) / (exp(y) + exp(-y)))

y <- expr(2 * x)
expr((exp(!!y) - exp(-!!y)) / (exp(!!y) + exp(-!!y)))
```

Referentially transparent code is easier to reason about because the names of objects don't matter, and because you can always work from the innermost parentheses outwards. You can simplify code by introducing named intermediates. \index{non-standard evaluation!drawbacks} \index{referential transparency}

There are many important functions that by their very nature are not referentially transparent. Take the assignment operator. You can't take `a <- 1` and replace `a` by its value and get the same behaviour. This is one reason that people usually write assignments at the top-level of functions. It's hard to reason about code like this:

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
if ((b <- a + 1) > (a <- b - 1)) {
  b <- b + 2
}
```

Not all functions can be referentially transparent, but it's worth striving for.

### Reducing duplication in dplyr

We can use these ideas to generate out own wrappers around dplyr functions. For example, imagine we want to group by one variable and compute the mean of another. We use `enexpr()` to capture the expression, and then unquoting to selectively evaluation.

```{r}
grouped_mean <- function(df, group_by, summarise) {
  group_by <- enexpr(group_by)
  summarise <- enexpr(summarise)
  
  df %>%
    group_by(!!group_by) %>%
    summarise(mean(!!summarise))
}
```

We can combine this idea with the previous by creating a wrapper around `desc()` that arranges all components in descrending order. We capture the dots with `exprs()`, wrap each in `desc()` by combining `map()` and `expr()`, and the use `!!!` to insert all expressions into `arrange()`.

```{r}
arrange_desc <- function(df, ...) {
  dots <- exprs(...)
  dots_desc <- map(dots, function(var) expr(desc(!!var)))
  
  dplyr::arrange(df, !!!dots_desc)
}
```

We'll come back to this case study in more detail in the next chapter. To be 100% correct, we need to use `quo()` rathrer than `expr()` for reasons we'll come back to shortly.

### Generating code

Quoting and unquoting give us powerful tools for generating code, particularly when combined with `purrr::map()` and `purr::reduce()`. For example, assume you have a linear model specified by the following coefficients:

```{r}
intercept <- 10
coefs <- c(x1 = 5, x2 = -4)
```

You want to convert it into an expression like `10 + (5 * x1) + (-4 * x2)` so you can evaluate it with new data. The first thing we need to turn is turn the character names vector into a list of symbols. `rlang::syms()` is designed precisely for this case:

```{r}
coef_sym <- syms(names(coefs))
coef_sym
```

Next we need to combine each variable name with its coefficient. We can do this by combining `expr()` with map `map2()`:

```{r}
summands <- map2(coef_sym, coefs, ~ expr((!!.x * !!.y)))
summands
```

In this case, the intercept is also a part of the sum, although it doesn't involve a multiplication. We can just add it to the start:

```{r}
summands <- c(intercept, summands)
summands
```

Finally, we need to reduce the individual terms in to a single sum by adding the pieces together:

```{r}
eq <- reduce(summands, ~ expr(!!.x + !!.y))
eq
```

Very many code generation problems can be solved in a similar way, combining quasiquotation with map functions.

## Dots and `do.call`

Final topic; not exactly quasiquotation, because there's no quotation involved, but closely related because you want to use `!!!` and `!!` in one special location.

There are three common uses of `...`, two of which you've already seen:

* To forward extra arguments to another function, [fun-dot-dot-dot].

* To allow S3 methods to have additional arguments that the generic does not,
  [s3-arguments]

* To create new data structures with named components. We've seen three
  examples: `structure()`, `list()`, `data.frame()`. Also similar to
  `base::transform()`, and `dplyr::mutute()` and friends, which allow you to
  create arbitrarily named new arguments.

For this type of function it's useful to support quasiquotation, not because you're trying to build up a complex AST, but because you're trying to build up a complex data structure.  

### Multiple arguments vs. multiple components

Useful to be able to flexibly pass either multiple arguments, or multiple elements in list. 

For example, take `base::rbind()`. This allows you to join together multiple data frames into one.

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 2)
df2 <- data.frame(x = 3, y = 4)
rbind(df1, df2)
```

But what if you have those two data frames in a list?

```{r}
dfs <- list(df1, df2)
rbind(dfs)
```

Ideally you'd like to be able to do `rbind(!!!dfs)`, but because base R doesn't support quasiquotation you have to use `do.call`:

```{r}
do.call(rbind, dfs)
```

If you have some data frames as objects, and some in lists, this gets complicat really fast.

To help overcome this problem in packages, rlang provides `dots_list()`, which makes it easy to turn `...` into a list supporting quasiqutation with `!!` and `!!!`, and adding one new feature: `:=`.

```{r}
dplyr::bind_rows(!!!dfs)
```

This operation is called splatting in many languages (e.g. ruby). Python calls this star-args, or star-star-args. `*args` and `kwargs`.

Note that `bind_rows()` doesn't support quasiquotation (i.e. `!!`) - but it does support `!!!`. We call functions like this "tidy dots".

### Names as arguments

Another common problem is that you want to name one of the components with a variable. For example, say you:

```{r}
name <- "variable"
value <- 1:4
```

And you want to create:

```{r}
data.frame(variable = value)
```

There's no way to do this directly with base R. You either have to use `do.call()` or `setNames()` afterwards:

```{r}
setNames(data.frame(value), name)
do.call(data.frame, setNames(list(value), name))
```

This problem is easier to solve with functions that use `dots_list()`, like `tibble::tibble()`:

```{r}
tibble::tibble(!!name := value)
```

We need a new operator, `:=`, because R's grammar only allows a symbol on the LHS of `=`. This makes any attempt to unquote a syntax error:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tibble::tibble(!!name = value)
#> Error: unexpected '=' in "tibble::tibble(!!name ="
```

`:=` is like a vestigal organ: it's recognised by the parser, but it doesn't have any code associated with it. It looks like an `=` but allows any expression on the LHS, providing a flexible alternative to `=`. If you've used data.table, you might've also seen it used there for similar reasons.

### `do.call`

As well as the non-quoting variants which basically provide alternatives to `!!`, one function provides a collective alternative to `!!!` and `:=`: `do.call()`. `do.call()` allows you to call a function with a list of arguments, allowing you manipulate that list in the usual way.

```{r}
var <- "x"
value <- 1:3

do.call(data.frame, setNames(list(value), var))
```

```{r}
tibble::tibble(!!var := value)
```

Or if you have many data frames that you want to bind together, you can use `do.call()` + `rbind()`:

```{r}
dfs <- replicate(5, data.frame(x = runif(1)), simplify = FALSE)
do.call(rbind, dfs)
```

Equivalent to `bind_rows(!!!dfs)`.  (For historical reasons, `bind_rows(dfs)` also works but if I was to write it today, it would require explicit unsplicing.)

### Invoke

One useful application of `dots_list()` is `invoke()`

(Neither `purrr::invoke()` nor `rlang::invoke()` currently use this definition, but that should change.)

```{r}
invoke <- function(.f, ...) {
  do.call(.f, dots_list(...))
}

invoke(mean, x = 1:10, na.rm = TRUE)
x <- list(x = 1:10, na.rm = TRUE)

invoke(mean, !!!x)

arg_name <- "na.rm"
arg_val <- TRUE
invoke(mean, 1:10, !!arg_name := arg_val)
```

This is useful for calling functions with a list of fixed (provided by function author) and varying (provided by function) arguments. 

```{r}
glm_pred <- function(data, formula, glm_args = list(), predict_args = list()) {
  mod <- invoke(glm, data = data, formula = formula, !!!glm_args)
  invoke(predict, object = mod, !!!predict_args)
}
```

In this case, it's good practice to use full name for all arguments supplied by you (the function author).

(This is not quite adequate for `glm()` because it uses standard-NSE. We'll talk about that in more detail later.)

### `lang()`

A similar 

```{r}
lang("mean", x = 1:10, na.rm = TRUE)

x <- list(x = 1:10, na.rm = TRUE)
lang("mean", !!!x)

arg_name <- "na.rm"
arg_val <- TRUE
lang("mean", 1:10, !!arg_name := arg_val)
```
