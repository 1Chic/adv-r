## Introduction

Now that you understand the tree structure of R code, it's time to come back to some of the fundamental ideas that make `quote()` and `ast()` work. Now we're going to talk about __quotation__, the art of capturing R code in arguments without evaluating it. 

As well as quoting, we'll also learn more about unquoting. We'll first dive into the details of quasiquotation as implemented by rlang. Quasiquotation provides a complete system of quotation because it as well as "quoting" the input, it also allows you to selectively __unquote__ make it easy to compose expressions that are mixture of direct and indirect specification.

We'll finish off the chapter with a look at how base R handles the problem. You'll see the quoting equivalents of rlang's quasiquotation operators, and learn about some of the variety of options that base R uses.

## Quasiquotation

With these basics in place it's time to come back to quasiquotation. Part of the magic of R is that a number of functions use the AST of the input, rather than the result of the computation. This is sometimes called __quoting__ an argument, because instead of using it directly we give a reference to it. 

Let's make this more concrete with an example. For example, imagine you're creating a lot of strings by joining together words:

```{r}
paste("Good", "morning", "Hadley")
paste("Good", "afternoon", "Alice")
```

You might get sick of writing all the quotes, and instead come up with a function like this (later we'll come back to how this function is implemented. For now just look at the results)

```{r}
cement <- function(...) {
  exprs(...) %>% 
    map(expr_name) %>% 
    paste(collapse = " ")
}

cement(Good, morning, Hadley)
cement(Good, afternoon, Alice)
```

This is useful because it allows us to save some typing. (The tradeoff is probably not really worth it here, but it's an illustrative example). The problem, however, comes when we want to use variables. It's easy to use variables with `paste()`, because we simple don't quote them:

```{r}
name <- "Hadley"
time <- "morning"

paste("Good", name, time)
```

This doesn't work with `cement()` because every input is automatically quoted:

```{r}
cement(Good, time, name)
```

We need some way to explicit __unquote__ the input, to tell `cement` to use the value stored inside the variables instead of the name of the variables. We need to tell `cement()` that `time` and `name` should be handled differently to `Good`. 

Quasiquotation give us a standard tool to do so: `!!`, prounounced bang-bang.

```{r}
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

### Quasiquotation foundations

To use quasiquotation in your own code you need to use one of the following functions:

* `expr()` captures its argument exactly as given. You'll use this most
  commonly for interactive exploration.

* `enexpr()` takes the name of an argument to a function, and returns
  the expression provided by that argument.
  
* `exprs()` captures all arguments. You can use it interactively to generate
  a list of expressions, or inside a function to capture all arguments
  provided to `...`.

There are also three variants called `quo()`, `enquo()`, `quos()`. These capture both the expression and the environment, and we'll come back to in the next chapter.

The opposite of quoting is evaluating. This is a big topic, so it is covered in depth in the next chapter. For now, we'll focus on a single function: `eval_tidy()`. This takes an expression and evaluates in it.

```{r}
x <- expr(runif(5))
x

eval_tidy(x)
```

Generally, this two step process of quoting and evaluation is equivalent to evaluating directly, but you'll some caveats in the next chapter.

### How it works

`substitute()` works because function arguments are represented by a special type of object called a __promise__. A promise captures the expression needed to compute the value and the environment in which to compute it. You're not normally aware of promises because the first time you access a promise its code is evaluated in its environment, yielding a value. \index{promises}


`!!` is treated differently  Can unquote at any level.

This is how `lobstr::ast()` works. 

```{r}
x <- quote(g(z))
lobstr::ast(f(!!x, y))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

```{r}
x <- exprs(g(z), a, b)
lobstr::ast(f(!!!x, y))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

There's one final component to quasiquotation: `:=`. One challenge that sometimes crops up is that the LHS of `=` is always quoted. 

```{r}
name <- "x"
value <- 10

lobstr::ast(c(name = value))
lobstr::ast(c(name = !!value))
```

And you can't unquote on the LHS because in R's grammar is has to be a bare name, so attempting to unquote is a syntax error.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lobstr::ast(c(!!name = !!value))
```

This doesn't work quite yet: https://github.com/tidyverse/rlang/issues/279

```{r}
lobstr::ast(c(!!name := !!value))
```

### Terminology

We call functions like `ast()` and `quote()` that capture their arguments without evaluating them quoting functions. 

Support quasiquotation if ...

Functions that quote their arguments in rlang all also support unquoting.

(We're working on improving the documentation to make this more clear. Hopefully by the time that you're reading this things are better.)

### Operator precedence

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- quote(X)
y <- quote(Y)
lobstr::ast(!!x + !!y)
```

THIS MIGHT CHANGE.

```{r}
z1 <- quote(!!x + !!y)
lobstr::ast(!!z1)

z1 <- quote((!!x) + (!!y))
lobstr::ast(!!z1)

z2 <- quote(UQ(x) + UQ(y))
lobstr::ast(!!z2)

lobstr::ast(UQ(x) + UQ(y))
```

### Constructing calls

To construct more complex calls, two new quasiquotation calls come in handy: 

*   `!!!`, pronounced bang-bang-bang, the unquote-splice operator. It allows you
    to splice in a list. Simply including the list in the call doesn't yield 
    quite what you want:

    ```{r}
    args <- list(x = 1, y = 2)
    lang("f", args, z = 3)
    ```
    
    Here we the unquote-splice operator:
    
    ```{r}
    lang("f", !!!args, z = 3)
    ```

*   `:=`, pronounced colon-equals, the definition operator. It works like `=` but
    allows you to splice on the left-hand side.

    ```{r}
    var <- "x"
    val <- 10
    
    lang("foo", var = val)
    lang("foo", !!var := val)
    ```

### Exercises

1.  Use `subs()` to convert the LHS to the RHS for each of the following pairs:
    * `a + b + c` -> `a * b * c`
    * `f(g(a, b), c)` -> `(a + b) * c`
    * `f(a < b, c, d)` -> `if (a < b) c else d`

2.  For each of the following pairs of expressions, describe why you can't
    use `subs()` to convert one to the other.
    * `a + b + c` -> `a + b * c`
    * `f(a, b)` -> `f(a, b, c)`
    * `f(a, b, c)` -> `f(a, b)`

## Base R

### Quoting equivalents

* `quote()` is like `expr()` with quasiquotation.

* `bquote()` is like `expr()` but provides a more limited form of 
  quasiquotation. Can only unquote, not unquote-splice, using `.`.
  Not used to provide quasiquotation for any other function in R.

* `substitute()` is similar to `enexpr()`. Its primary purpose is to
  capture unevaluated arguments, but it also does a bunch of other stuff

### Unquoting

Many quoting functions have no way to unquote. Those that do tend to have idiosyncratic approaches.

* `rm()` uses a different arguemnt
* `library()` uses an argument to switch between
* `$` is paired with `[[`

How to use `expr()` + `eval_tidy()` to support wrap base functions.

```{r, error = TRUE, fig.keep = "none"}
library(lattice)
xyplot(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars)

x <- quote(mpg)
y <- quote(disp)
xyplot(x ~ y, data = mtcars)
```



### The downsides of non-standard evaluation {#nse-downsides}

The biggest downside of NSE is that functions that use it are no longer [referentially transparent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)). A function is __referentially transparent__ if you can replace its arguments with their values and its behaviour doesn't change. For example, if a function, `f()`, is referentially transparent and both `x` and `y` are 10, then `f(x)`, `f(y)`, and `f(10)` will all return the same result. Referentially transparent code is easier to reason about because the names of objects don't matter, and because you can always work from the innermost parentheses outwards. \index{non-standard evaluation!drawbacks}

There are many important functions that by their very nature are not referentially transparent. Take the assignment operator. You can't take `a <- 1` and replace `a` by its value and get the same behaviour. This is one reason that people usually write assignments at the top-level of functions. It's hard to reason about code like this:

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
if ((b <- a + 1) > (a <- b - 1)) {
  b <- b + 2
}
```

Using NSE prevents a function from being referentially transparent. This makes the mental model needed to correctly predict the output much more complicated. So, it's only worthwhile to use NSE if there is significant gain. For example, `library()` and `require()` can be called either with or without quotes, because internally they use `deparse(substitute(x))` plus some other tricks. This means that these two lines do exactly the same thing: \index{referential transparency}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library("ggplot2")
```

Things start to get complicated if the variable is associated with a value. What package will this load?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot2 <- "plyr"
library(ggplot2)
```

There are a number of other R functions that work in this way, like `ls()`, `rm()`, `data()`, `demo()`, `example()`, and `vignette()`. To me, eliminating two keystrokes is not worth the loss of referential transparency, and I don't recommend you use NSE for this purpose.

One situation where non-standard evaluation is worthwhile is `data.frame()`. If not explicitly supplied, it uses the input to automatically name the output variables:

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- "a"
df <- data.frame(x, y)
names(df)
```

I think it's worthwhile because it eliminates a lot of redundancy in the common scenario when you're creating a data frame from existing variables. More importantly, if needed, it's easy to override this behaviour by supplying names for each variable.

Non-standard evaluation allows you to write functions that are extremely powerful. However, they are harder to understand and to program with. As well as always providing an escape hatch, carefully consider both the costs and benefits of NSE before using it in a new domain.

### Exercises

1.  What does the following function do? What's the escape hatch?
    Do you think that this is an appropriate use of NSE?

    ```{r}
    nl <- function(...) {
      dots <- named_dots(...)
      lapply(dots, eval, parent.frame())
    }
    ```

2.  Instead of relying on promises, you can use formulas created with `~`
    to explicitly capture an expression and its environment. What are the
    advantages and disadvantages of making quoting explicit? How does it
    impact referential transparency?

3.  Read the standard non-standard evaluation rules found at
    <http://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf>.

1.  Why does `as.Date.default()` use `substitute()` and `deparse()`?
    Why does `pairwise.t.test()` use them? Read the source code.

1.  `pairwise.t.test()` assumes that `deparse()` always returns a length one 
    character vector. Can you construct an input that violates this expectation? 
    What happens?

1.  `f()`, defined above, just calls `substitute()`. Why can't we use it
    to define `g()`? In other words, what will the following code return?
    First make a prediction. Then run the code and think about the results.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f <- function(x) substitute(x)
    g <- function(x) deparse(f(x))
    g(1:10)
    g(x)
    g(x + y ^ 2 / z + exp(a * sin(b)))
    ```

1.  Base functions `match.fun()`, `page()`, and `ls()` all try to
    automatically determine whether you want standard or non-standard
    evaluation. Each uses a different approach. Figure out the essence
    of each approach then compare and contrast.
