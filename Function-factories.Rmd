## Introduction

A __function factory__ is a function that creates functions. Here's a very simple example: we use a function factory (`power1()`) to make two child functions (`square()` and `cube()`):

```{r}
power1 <- function(exp) {
  force(exp)
  
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}

square <- power1(2)
cube <- power1(3)
```

I'll call `square()` and `cube()` __manufactured functions__, but this is just a term to ease communication with other humans. From R's perspective they are no different to functions created any other way:

```{r}
square(3)
cube(3)
```

You have already learned about the individual components that make function factories possible:

* In Section \@ref(first-class-functions), you learned about R's "first class" 
  functions and how `<-` binds a function to a name in the same way as for 
  other objects.

* In Section \@ref(the-function-environment), you learned that a function
  captures, or encloses, the environment it which it is created.

* In Section \@ref(execution-environments), you learned that a function 
  creates a new execution environment every time it is run. This environment
  is usually ephemeral, but here it becomes the enclosing environment of 
  the manufactured function.

In this chapter, you'll learn the non-obvious combination of these three features that lead to function factory. Of the three main FP tools, function factories are the least useful. Generally, they don't tend to reduce overall code complexity. Instead, they provide a toolkit for breaking down a complex problem into smaller pieces that can be considered separately. They are also an important building block for the very useful function operators, which you'll learn about in the next chapter.

### Outline {-}

* Section \@ref(factory-fundamentals) begins the chapter with a description
  of how function factories work, pulling together ideas from scoping and 
  environments.

* Section \@ref(stat-fact) uses function factories to help solve two statistical
  challenge: maximum likelihood estimation and boostrapping. In both examples,
  you'll see how function factories can partition work, in order to do some
  upfront, and save time in the long-run.
  
* Section \@ref(mutable-state) shows how you can use `<<-` with function 
  factories in order to preserve state across function calls. You'll learn 
  a richer approach in [R6], but a function factory can be useful for simple 
  cases, like capturing the number of times a function is called. 

* Section \@ref(numerical-integration) explores numerical integration: 
  starting with simple pieces like midpoint, trapezoid, Simpson, and Boole
  and rules, and showing how they can all be generated with a single
  function factory.

* Section \@ref(functional-factories) shows how you can combine function
  factories with functionals to rapidly generate a family of functions
  from data.

### Prerequisites {-}

Make sure you're familiar with the contents of Sections \@ref(first-class-functions), \@ref(the-function-environment), and \@ref(execution-environments) mentioned above.

Function factories rely on base R functionality, but we'll use a little rlang to more easily peek inside of them. You'll need the development version which includes some tweaks. We'll also use ggplot2 which has a number of components that pair well with function factories.

```{r setup}
# devtools::install_github("r-lib/rlang")
library(rlang)

library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```

## Factory fundamentals
\index{closures|see{functions}}

The key idea that makes function factories work can be expressed very concisely:

> The enclosing environment of the manufactured function is the execution
> environment of the function factory. 

While it takes few words to express the big ideas, it takes quite a bit of thinking to fully understand what's going on. This section will help you put the pieces together with interactive exploration and some diagrams.

### Environments

Let's start by taking a look at `square()` and `cube()`:

```{r}
square

cube
```

Printing manufactured functions is not revealing because the bodies are identical, and the contents of the environments are not printed. We can get a little more insight by using `rlang::env_print()`. That shows us that we have two different environments, each of which was originally the execution environment of `power()`. The environments have the same parent, which is the enclosing environment of `power1()`, the global environment.

```{r}
env_print(square)

env_print(cube)
```

While `env_print()` shows us that both environments have a binding to `exp`, to see key difference, we need to extract the value of `exp` (a future version of `env_print()` is likely to do better at summarising the contents so you don't need this step). That's easily done with `env_get()`:

```{r}
env_get(square, "exp")

env_get(cube, "exp")
```

### Diagram conventions

We can also show these relationships in a diagram:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/function-factories/power-full.png", dpi = 300)
```

There's a lot going on this diagram and some of the details aren't that important. We can simplify considerably by using two conventions:

* Any free floating symbol lives in the global environment.

* Any environment without an explicit parent inherits from the global 
  environment.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/function-factories/power-simple.png", dpi = 300)
```

This view, which focuses on the environments, doesn't show any direct link between `cube()` and `square()`. That's because the link is the through the body of the function, which is identical for both, but is not shown in this diagram.

### Potential pitfalls

There are two potentail pitfalls you need to be aware of when creating your own function factories: lazy evaluation and accidental capture of large objects. 

If you don't eagerly evaluate every argument to a function factory, it's possible to get confusing behaviour:

```{r}
power2 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}

exp2 <- 2
square2 <- power2(exp2)
exp2 <- 3

square2(2)
```

This is described in \@ref(forcing-evaluation), and happens when a binding changes in between calling the factory function and calling the manufactured function. This is likely to only happen rarely, but will lead to a real head-scratcher of a bug. Avoid future pain by ensuring every argument is evaluated, using `force()` where needed.

You usually don't worry about creating large temporary objects inside a function because the execution environment is ephemeral, and all objects are unbound when function completes. However, manufactured functions hold on to the execution environment, so you'll need to explicitly unbind any large temporary objects with `rm()`. Compare the sizes of `g1()` and `g2()` in the example below:

```{r}
f1 <- function(n) {
  x <- runif(n)
  m <- mean(x)
  function() m
}

g1 <- f1(1e6)
lobstr::obj_size(g1)

f2 <- function(n) {
  x <- runif(n)
  m <- mean(x)
  rm(x)
  function() m
}

g2 <- f2(1e6)
lobstr::obj_size(g2)
```

### Exercises

1.  Base R contains two function factories, `approxfun()` and `ecdf()`. 
    Read their documentation and experiment to figure out what the functions 
    do and what they return.

1.  Create a function `pick()` that takes an index, `i`, as an argument and 
    returns a function with an argument `x` that subsets `x` with `i`.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    pick(1)(x)
    # should be equivalent to
    x[[1]]
    
    lapply(mtcars, pick(5))
    # should be equivalent to
    lapply(mtcars, function(x) x[[5]])
    ```

## Graphical factories {#graph-fact}

ggplot2 provides a number of motivating examples

### Labelling

Axes: `scales::number_format()`

Facets: `label_bquote()`

### Histogram bins

```{r}
# construct some sample data with very different numbers in each cell
n <- c(10, 100, 1000)
```

Same number of bins in each:

```{r}
binwidth_bins <- function(n) {
  force(n)
  
  function(x) {
    (max(x) - min(x)) / n
  }
}

ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = binwidth_bins(5)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ cyl)
```

```{r}
base_bins <- function(type) {
  fun <- switch(type,
    Sturges = nclass.Sturges,
    scott = nclass.scott,
    FD = nclass.FD,
    stop("Unknown type", call. = FALSE)
  )
  
  function(x) {
    (max(x) - min(x)) / fun(x)
  }
}

ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = base_bins("FD")) + 
  facet_wrap(~ cyl)
```

### ggsave

`ggplot2:::plot_dev()`
Simplified version below.
Takes an extension and returns a function that opens a graphics device. It's designed to shim over minor differences in the device functions in base R: 

* most have `filename` as first argument but some have `file`
* dimensions of raster graphics are usually in pixels, where vector graphics
  are in inches.
* some file formats have multiple common extensions.

```{r}
plot_dev <- function(ext, dpi = 96) {
  switch(ext,
    eps =  ,
    ps  =  function(filename, ...) {
      grDevices::postscript(
        file = filename, ..., onefile = FALSE, 
        horizontal = FALSE, paper = "special"
      )
    },
    tex =  function(filename, ...) grDevices::pictex(file = filename, ...),
    pdf =  function(filename, ...) grDevices::pdf(file = filename, ...),
    svg  = function(filename, ...) svglite::svglite(file = filename, ...),
    emf  = ,
    wmf  = function(...) grDevices::win.metafile(...),
    png  = function(...) grDevices::png(..., res = dpi, units = "in"),
    jpg  = ,
    jpeg = function(...) grDevices::jpeg(..., res = dpi, units = "in"),
    bmp  = function(...) grDevices::bmp(..., res = dpi, units = "in"),
    tiff = function(...) grDevices::tiff(..., res = dpi, units = "in")
  )
}
```

## Statistical factories {#stat-fact}

Our first motivating examples for function factories come from statistics:

* The Box-Cox transformation
* Boostrapping 
* Maximum likelihood estimation. 

All these examples can be tackled without function factories, but I think they're a good fit for these problems and admit elegant solutions. These examples expect some statistical background, so feel free to skip if they don't make much sense to you.

### Box-Cox transformation
\index{Box-Cox transformation}

The Box-Cox transformation is a flexible transformation often used to transform  data towards normality. It has a single parameter, $\lambda$ which controls the strength of the transformation:

```{r}
boxcox <- function(lambda) {
  if (lambda == 0) {
    function(x) log(x)
  } else {
    function(x) (x ^ lambda - 1) / lambda
  }
}
```

Formulating `boxcox()` as a function factory makes it easy to explore its behaviour with `stat_function()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 5)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(aes(colour = "1"), fun = boxcox(1)) + 
  stat_function(aes(colour = "2"), fun = boxcox(2)) +
  stat_function(aes(colour = "0.5"), fun = boxcox(0.5))

ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0.01, 1)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(aes(colour = "0.5"), fun = boxcox(0.5)) + 
  stat_function(aes(colour = "0.25"), fun = boxcox(0.25)) +
  stat_function(aes(colour = "0"), fun = boxcox(0))
```

### Bootstrap generators
\index{boostraping generator}

Function factories are a useful way for thinking about bootstrapping because instead of thinking about a single bootstrap (you always need more than one!), you than think about a bootstrap __generator__, a function that yields a fresh boostrap every time it is called:

```{r}
boot_permute <- function(df, var) {
  n <- nrow(df)
  force(var)
  
  function() {
    df[[var]][sample(n, n, replace = TRUE)]
  }
}

boot_mtcars1 <- boot_permute(mtcars, "mpg")
head(boot_mtcars1())
head(boot_mtcars1())
```

The advantage of a function factory is more clear with a parametric bootstrap where we have to first fit a model. We can do this setup step once, when the factory is called, rather than once every time we generate the bootstrap:

```{r}
boot_model <- function(df, formula) {
  mod <- lm(formula, data = df)
  fitted <- unname(fitted(mod))
  resid <- unname(resid(mod))
  rm(mod)

  function() {
    fitted + sample(resid)
  }
} 

boot_mtcars2 <- boot_model(mtcars, mpg ~ wt)
head(boot_mtcars2())
head(boot_mtcars2())
```

I use `rm(mod)` because linear model objects are quite large (they include complete copies of the model matrix and input data) and I want to keep the generator function as small as possible.

### Maximum likelihood estimation {#MLE}
\index{maximum likelihood}
\indexc{optimise()}
\indexc{optim()}

The goal of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is to find the parameter values for a distribution that make the observed data "most likely". To do MLE, you start with a probability function. Let's work through a simple example, using the Poisson distribution. For example, if we know $\lambda$, we can compute the probability of getting a vector $\mathbf{x}$ of values ($x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$) by multiplying the Poisson probability function as follows:

\[ P(\lambda, \mathbf{x}) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\lambda ^ {x_i} e^{-\lambda}}{x_i!} \]

In statistics, we almost always work with the log of this function. The log is a monotonic transformation which preserves important properties (i.e. the extrema occur in the same place), but has specific advantages:

* The log turns a product into a sum, which is easier to work with.

* Multiplying small numbers yields an even smaller number, which makes floating point math more challenging. Logged values are more numerically stable.

Let's log transform this probability function and simplify it as much as possible:

\[ \log(P(\lambda, \mathbf{x})) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(\frac{\lambda ^ {x_i} e^{-\lambda}}{x_i!}) \]

\[ \log(P(\lambda, \mathbf{x})) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i \log(\lambda) - \lambda - \log(x_i!) \right) \]

\[ \log(P(\lambda, \mathbf{x})) = 
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \log(\lambda)
   - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda 
   - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(x_i!) \]

\[ \log(P(\lambda, \mathbf{x})) = 
   \log(\lambda) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - n \lambda - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(x_i!) \]

We can now turn this function into an R function. The R function is quite elegant because R is vectorised and, because it's a statistical programming language, R comes with built-in functions like the log-factorial (`lfactorial()`).

```{r}
lprob_poisson <- function(lambda, x) {
  n <- length(x)
  log(lambda) * sum(x) - n * lambda - sum(lfactorial(x))
}
```

Consider this vector of observations:

```{r}
x1 <- c(41, 30, 31, 38, 29, 24, 30, 29, 31, 38)
```

We can use `lprob_poisson()` to compute the (logged) probability of `x1` for different values of `lambda`. 

```{r}
lprob_poisson(10, x1)
lprob_poisson(20, x1)
lprob_poisson(30, x1)
```

The key idea of maximum likelihood is to think about the probability function in a different way. So far we've been thinking of `lambda` as fixed and known and the function tells us the probability of getting different `x` values. But in real-life, we observe the `x` and it is `lambda` that is unknown. The likelihood is the probability function, seen through this lens: we want to find the `lambda` that makes the observed `x` the "most likely". That is, given `x`, what value of `lambda` gives us the highest value of `lprob_poisson()`? 

In R, we can make this change in perspective more clear by using a function factory. We provide `x` and generate a function with a single parameter, `lambda`:

```{r}
ll_poisson <- function(x) {
  n <- length(x)

  function(lambda) {
    log(lambda) * sum(x) - n * lambda - sum(lfactorial(x))
  }
}
```

One nice thing about this approach is we can do some precomputation: any term that only involves `x` can be computed once in the factory. This is useful, because we're going to need to call this function many times to find the best `lambda`.

```{r}
ll_poisson <- function(x) {
  n <- length(x)
  sum_x <- sum(x)
  c <- sum(lfactorial(x))

  function(lambda) {
    log(lambda) * sum_x - n * lambda - c
  }
}
```

Now we can use this function to find the value of `lambda` that maximizes the (log) likelihood:

```{r}
ll1 <- ll_poisson(x1)

ll1(10)
ll1(20)
ll1(30)
```

Rather than trial and error, we can automate the process of finding the best value with `optimise()`. The results tell us that the highest value is `-30.27` which occurs when `lambda = 32.1`:

```{r}
optimise(ll1, c(0, 100), maximum = TRUE)
```

Now, we could have solved this problem without using a function factory because `optimise()` passes `...` on to the function being optimised. That means we could use the log-probability function directly:

```{r}
optimise(lprob_poisson, c(0, 100), x = x1, maximum = TRUE)$maximum
```

The advantage of using a function factory here is fairly small, but there are two niceties:

* We can precompute some values in the factory itself, saving computation time
  in each iteration.
  
* I think the two-level design better reflects the mathematical structure of 
  the underlying problem.

These advantages get bigger in more complex MLE problems, where you have multiple parameters and multiple data vectors.


### Exercises

1.  In `boot_model()`, why don't I need to force the evaluation of `df` 
    or `model`?

1.  Create a function that creates functions that compute the ith 
    [central moment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_moment) of a numeric 
    vector. You can test it by running the following code:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    m1 <- moment(1)
    m2 <- moment(2)

    x <- runif(100)
    stopifnot(all.equal(m1(x), 0))
    stopifnot(all.equal(m2(x), var(x) * 99 / 100))
    ```

1.  Why don't you need to worry that `boot_permute()` stores a copy of the 
    data inside the function that it generates?

1.  Things are slightly less elegant when we generalise to more parameters 
    because `optim()`, the n-d generalisation of `optimise()`, calls the 
    function with a single argument containing a vector of parameters.

    ```{r}
    nll_normal <- function(x) {
      n <- length(x)
      
      function(params) {
        mu <- params[[1]]
        sigma <- params[[2]]
        
        n * log(sigma) + sum((x - mu) ^ 2) / (2 * sigma ^ 2)
      }
    }
    
    x3 <- c(10.1, 6.12, 8.48, 6.07, 5.27, 5.06, 6.51, 4.34, 3.68, 5.48)
    nll3 <- nll_normal(x1)
    optim(c(0, 1), nll3)$par
    ```

## Mutable state {#mutable-state}
\indexc{<<-} 
\index{copy-on-modify!exceptions}

Having variables at two levels allows you to maintain state across function invocations. This is possible because while the execution environment is refreshed every time, the enclosing environment is constant. The key to managing variables at different levels is the double arrow assignment operator (`<<-`). Unlike the usual single arrow assignment (`<-`) that always assigns in the current environment, the double arrow operator will keep looking up the chain of parent environments until it finds a matching name. (Section \@label(binding) has more details on how it works.)

Together, a static parent environment and `<<-` make it possible to maintain state across function calls. The following example shows a counter that records how many times a function has been called. Each time `new_counter` is run, it creates an environment, initialises the counter `i` in this environment, and then creates a new function.

```{r}
new_counter <- function() {
  i <- 0
  function() {
    i <<- i + 1
    i
  }
}

counter_one <- new_counter()
counter_two <- new_counter()
```

The enclosing environments of `counter_one()` and `counter_two()` are indepedent because they are the execution environments of `new_counter()` (which is different each time it's called). Ordinarily, function execution environments are temporary, but a closure maintains access to the environment in which it was created. In the example below, closures `counter_one()` and `counter_two()` each get their own enclosing environments when run, so they can maintain different counts.

```{r}
counter_one()
counter_one()
counter_two()
```

The counters get around the "fresh start" limitation by not modifying variables in their execution environment, but in their enclosing environment.

Modifying values in a parent environment is an important technique because it is one way to generate "mutable state" in R. Mutable state is normally hard because every time it looks like you're modifying an object, you're actually creating and then modifying a copy. However, if you do need mutable objects and your code is not very simple, it's usually better to use R6, the topic of Chapter \@ref(R6).

### Exercises

1.  What happens if you don't use a closure? Make predictions then verify with 
    the code below.

    ```{r}
    i <- 0
    new_counter2 <- function() {
      i <<- i + 1
      i
    }
    ```

1.  What happens if you use `<-` instead of `<<-`? Make predictions then verify 
    with the code below.

    ```{r}
    new_counter3 <- function() {
      i <- 0
      function() {
        i <- i + 1
        i
      }
    }
    ```

## Function factories + functionals {#functional-factories}

Easily create a bunch of functions at once.

```{r}
names <- list(
  square = 2, 
  cube = 3, 
  root = 1/2, 
  cuberoot = 1/3, 
  reciprocal = -1
)
funs <- purrr::map(names, power1)
funs$root(64)

funs$root
```

If the functional has two arguments, you could use `map2()`, and if it has 3 or more, you could use a data frame plus `pmap()`.

See alternative approach in translation - uses quasiquotation so requires more knowledge, but has the advantage of generating functions with more readable bodies, and avoids accidentally capturing large objects in the enclosing scope. The following code is a quick preview of how we could rewrite `power1()` to use quasiquotation instead of a function factory. You'll learn more about this in Section \@ref(quasi-function).

```{r}
library(rlang)
power3 <- function(exponent) {
  new_function(exprs(x = ), expr({
    x ^ !!exponent
  }), env = caller_env())
}

funs <- purrr::map(names, power3)
funs$root(64)
funs$root
```

### Exercises

1.  Instead of creating individual functions (e.g., `midpoint()`, 
    `trapezoid()`, `simpson()`, etc.), we could store them in a list. If we 
    did that, how would that change the code? Can you create the list of 
    functions from a list of coefficients for the Newton-Cotes formulae?
