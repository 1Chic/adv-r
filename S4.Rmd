# S4

The S4 system takes the same basic ideas as S3 but provides a rigorous and strict implementation. There are three main differences between S3 and S4:

* S4 classes have formal definitions provided by a call to `setClass()`.
  An S4 class can have multiple parent classes.
  
* The fields of an S4 object don't use attributes or named elements, but 
  instead are called __slots__ and are accessed with the special `@` operator.
  
* Methods are not defined with a naming convention, but are instead
  defined by a call to `setMethod()`. S4 methods can dispatch on multiple
  arguments.
  
S4 is a rich system, and it's not possible to cover all of it in one chapter. Instead, we'll focus on what you need to know to write or read most S4 code, avoiding discussion of esoterica. To learn more, some good references are:

* [S4 system development in Bioconductor][S4-bioconductor], a slide deck
  by Patrick Aboyoun.

* [S4 questions on stackoverflow][SO-Morgan] answered by Martin Morgan.

* [_Software for Data Analysis_][S4DA], a book by John Chambers.

All functions related to S4 live in the methods package. This package is always available when you're running R interactively, but may not be available when running R in batch mode (i.e. from `Rscript`). For this reason, it's a good idea to call `library(methods)` whenever you use S4. This also signals to the reader that you'll be using the S4 object system.

```{r setup}
library(methods)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Hide annoying output
setMethod <- function(...) invisible(methods::setMethod(...))
setGeneric <- function(...) invisible(methods::setGeneric(...))
```

## Classes

Unlike S3, S4 classes have a formal definition. To define an S4 class, you must define key properties:

* The class __name__. By convention, S4 class names use UpperCamelCase.

* A named list that describes the names and classes of the __slots__ (fields).
  For example, a person class might be represented by a character name and a 
  numeric age: `list(name = "character", age = "numeric")`. The special 
  "ANY" allows objects of any type. \index{slots}

* A string giving the class it inherits from, or, in S4 terminology,
  that it __contains__. You can provide multiple classes for multiple
  inheritance, but this is an advanced technique which adds much
  complexity.

S4 objects can inherit from and include as slots base types and S3 classes. We'll come back to the details at the end of the chapter.

To create a class, you call `setClass()`, supplying these three properties. 

Lets make this concrete with an example. Here we create two classes: a person has character `name` and numeric `age`, and an employee inherits slots and methods from `Person`, adding an additional `boss` slot that must be a `Person`.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
setClass("Person", slots = list(name = "character", age = "numeric"))
setClass("Employee", contains = "Person", slots = list(boss = "Person"))
```

`setClass()` has 10 other arguments, but they are all either deprecated or not recommended. If you have existing S4 code that uses them, I'd recommend carefully reading the documentation and upgrading to modern practice.

Once you have defined the class, you can create an object from that class by calling the collector constructor `new()`. The first argument is the name of the class, and the remaining named arguments specify the values of the slots.

```{r}
hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = 37)
hadley
```

In most programming languages, class definition occurs at compile-time, while object instantiation occurs at run-time. In R, however, both definition and construction occurs at run time. When you call `setClass()`, you are registering a class definition in a (hidden) global variable. As with all state-modifying functions you need to use `setClass()` with care. This isn't usually a problem, because you'll define a class once, then leave the definition alone. However, if you're experimenting with the class defintion interactively, it's possible to create invalid objects:

```{r, error = TRUE}
setClass("A", slots = list(x = "numeric"))
a <- new("A", x = 10)

setClass("A", slots = list(a_different_slot = "numeric"))
a
```

To avoid this problem in production code, you may want to "seal" the class:

```{r, error = TRUE}
setClass("Sealed", sealed = TRUE)
setClass("Sealed")
```

### Initialize method

`new()` serves as a low-level constructor so you don't need to write one yourself. However, the default behaviour has two drawbacks:

*   The default If you don't supply values, `new()` will use a default value for the slot class:

    ```{r}
    new("Person")
    ```
    
    For this class, you might prefer that `name` is always required, and that
    `age` defaults to `NA`.
    
*   It's not possible to create a S4 object with the wrong slots or 
    slots of the wrong type:

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = "thirty")
    new("Person", name = "Hadley", sex = "male")
    ```
    
    But it is possible to create slots with the wrong lengths:
    
    ```{r}
    new("Person", age = 1:10)
    ```

We can override these defaults by providing an `initialize()` method. You'll learn more about the details of creating methods with `setMethod()` in the next section, but in brief, the following code defines a `Person` method for the `intialize` generic.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
setMethod("initialize", "Person", function(.Object, name, age = NA_real_, ...) {
  stopifnot(length(name) == 1)
  stopifnot(length(age) == 1)
  
  .Object@name <- name
  .Object@age <- age
  
  callNextMethod(.Object, ...)
})
```

In your `intialize()` method you should provide named arguments for the slots that you want to check, or provide defaults for. __You__ are then responsible for setting those values with `@`. You should also provide `...` and pass that on to `callNextMethod()`. That will allow future subclasses to use your initialize method.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Name is now reqiured
new("Person")

# And must be length 1
new("Person", name = letters)

# And if not supplied, age gets a default value of NA
new("Person", name = "Hadley")
```

### Helper

As in S3, it's not necessary to provide a helper function, but you should if it's more natural to construct the object some other. For example, you could imagine creating a S4 representation of factors. There you still want to supply a `Factor()` helper that most people would use to construct the object.

```{r}
setClass("Factor", 
  slots = list(levels = "character"),
  contains = "integer"
)

Factor <- function(x, levels = unique(x)) {
  ind <- match(x, levels)
  new("Factor", ind, levels = levels)
}
```

This uses another form of `new()`: unnnamed arguments are taken to be objects of the superclass, which in this case is the base integer type.

### Validator

It's possible to use the built-in `setValidity()` function to define a validity method. However, I do not recommend using this because it is always run by `new()`. If your validation method is expensive, this means that you no longer have a cheap way to create objects when you already know the values are valid. 

Following the factor example, we could port out S3 `validate_factor()` function to an S4 `validateFactor()` function. There are two main differences: we use camelCase instead of snake_case for the function name, and we use `@` instead of `attr()` to access the fields of the object. Note the use of the special `.Data` slot: this only exists when you inherit from an S3 class or base type, and it allows you to get that underlying object.

```{r}
validateFactor <- function(x) {
  values <- x@.Data
  
  if (!all(!is.na(values) & values > 0)) {
    stop(
      "All `x` values must be non-missing and greater than zero",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }
  
  if (length(x@levels) < max(values)) {
    stop(
      "There must at least as many `levels` as possible values in `x`",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }
  
  x
}
```

### Introspection

`str()` and `View()` (in RStudio), continue to be useful tools for inspecting complex S4 object. But you'll also need to learn some new tools. To access the slots, use `@` or `slot()`; `@` is equivalent to `$`, and `slot()` to `[[`. \index{subsetting!S4} \index{S4|subsetting}

```{r}
hadley@age
slot(hadley, "age")
```

You can list all available slots with `slotNames()`:

```{r}
slotNames(hadley)
```

(Internally, slots are implemented as attributes, so you can also use `attributes()` to get a glimpse of all the components at once. This isn't recommended, however, as it's an internal implementation detail and hence a bad idea to rely on it.)

As a user, you should generally not extract values out of an object using `@`. The names of the slots are considered an internal implementation detail and may change without warning. Instead, look for a method that provides the information you want, and only access the slot directly if there's no other choice.

To determine what classes an object inherits from, use `is()`:

```{r}
is(hadley)
```

To test if an object inherits from a specific class, use the second argument of `is()`:

```{r}
is(hadley, "person")
```

## Generics and methods

The job of a generic is to perform method dispatch, i.e. find the method designed for the combination of classes passed to the generic. Here you'll learn how to define S4 generics and methods, then in the next section we'll dive into some of the details of S4 method dispatch. 

S4 generics have a similar structure to S3 generics, with a little more formalism. To create an new S4 generic, you call `setGeneric()` providing a function that calls `standardGeneric()`. \index{S4!generics} \index{S4!methods} \index{generics!S4} \index{methods!S4}.

```{r}
setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) {
  standardGeneric("myGeneric")
})
```

Like `setClass()`, `setGeneric()` has many other arguments, none of which you should ever need to use. Consult the documentation for details.

A generic isn't useful without some methods, and in S4 you add methods with `setMethod()`. There are three important arguments: the name of the generic, the name of the class, and the method itself. (Again `setMethod()` has other arguments, but you should never use them.)

```{r}
setMethod("myGeneric", "Person", function(x) {
  # method implementation
})
```

As with S3, the most commonly defined method controls how the object is printed. In S4, however, this method is called "show". When defining a method for an existing generic, you need first determine the arguments. You can you get those from the documentation or by looking at the formals of the generic. Unlike S3, if you get them wrong, `setMethod()` will tell you. 

```{r}
names(formals(show))
```

Here we define a show method for Person, in order to improve the default output. 

```{r}
setMethod("show", "Person", function(object) {
  cat("Person\n")
  cat("  Name: ", object@name, "\n", sep = "")
  cat("  Age:  ", object@age, "\n", sep = "")
})
hadley
```

More formally, the second argument to `setMethod()` is called the __signature__. In S4, unlike S3, the signature can include multiple arguments. This makes method dispatch substantially more complicated, but avoids having to implement double-dispatch as a special case. We'll talk more about multiple dispatch in the next section.

### Introspection

Use `.S4methods` to list all the methods that belong to a generic, or that are associated with a class.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
.S4methods("initialize")
.S4methods(class = "Person")
```

If you're looking for the source for a specific method, you can use `selectMethod()`. You give it the name of the generic, and the class signature.

```{r}
selectMethod("show", "Person")
```

If you're using a method defined in a package, the easiest way to get help on it, is to construct a valid call, and then put `?` in front it. `?` will use the arguments to figure out which help file you need:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?show(hadley)
```

## Method dispatch 

S4 dispatch is complicated because S4 has multiple inheritance, i.e. a class can have multiple parents, and multiple dispatch, i.e. a generic can use multiple arguments to pick a method. This makes S4 extremely flexible, but can also make it hard to understand what's going on. To explain method dispatch, we'll start simple with single inheritance and single dispatch, and work out way up to the more complicated cases.

We're going to work an imaginary class graph that describes the relationships between some emoji  There are a couple of multiple inheritance relationships here. For example, `r emo::ji("sunglasses")` inherits from both `r emo::ji("dark_sunglasses")` and `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")`

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/class-graph.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Single dispatch

Let's start with a diagram for simplest case: a generic which dispatches on an object with single inheritance. The top of the diagram `f(...)` tells you that this diagram shows the methods for a generic with one argument, called with a simple class hierarchy. The bottom of the digram lists all the possible methods in diamonds. Note the special pseudo-class "ANY". This plays the role of the `.default` in S3, and matches any input.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single.png", dpi = 300)
```

Notice that the classes are arranged in different orders in the generic call vs. the method list. This is because you understand a class hierarchy by moving from the generic to the specific, but method dispatch looks for the most specific, before looking for the more general.

The diagram shows all possible methods. Usually, only a small subset of methods are defined: this is why you're using OO programming. I'll show which methods are defined by colouring the background of the diamond.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

Now we're in a position to explain how method dispatch works. You start with the class supplied to the generic, and then follow the arrows until you find a method that exists. Search proceeds from the most specific to the most general. For example:

* No method is found for `r emo::ji("stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye")`, 
  so next most general method is used: `r emo::ji("wink")`.

* No method is found for `r emo::ji("no_mouth")`, so the default "ANY" method 
  is used.

In this simple case, S4 dispatch is just the same as S3 dispatch.

### Multiple inheritance

The complexity in S4 dispatch comes from multiple dispatch, because an S4 generic can use the class of multiple arguments to choose the method. Here's minimal multiple dispatch method diagram.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

The basic process of dispatch remains the same. You start from the class you have, and follow the arrows until you find a defined method. The wrinkle is now that there are multiple arrows to follow, so you might find multiple methods. In that case, you pick the method that is closest to target class.

However, it's possible to have two methods that are equi-distant. For example, if we've defined methods for `r emo::ji("dark_sunglasses")` and `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")`, then `r emo::ji("sunglasses")` has the same distance, one, to both methods. This is a problem! In this scenario R will give a warning, and picks one basically at random (it uses the method that comes first in the alphabet). 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-ambig.png", dpi = 300)
```

You resolve this ambiguity by defining a more precise method.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-ambig-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

The fallback "ANY" method still exists but the rules a little more complex. As indicated by the wavy dotted lines, the "ANY" method is always considered further away than any other method. This means that it will never contribute to ambiguity.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-any.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Multiple dispatch

Once you understand dispatch with multiple inheritance, understanding inheritance with multiple dispatch is just a small step extra. The following shows the basic idea for double dispatch. Now each method takes a pair of classes, and we draw an arrow from one method to another if and only if both the left class and the right class inherit.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-single.png", dpi = 300)
```

The main difference with multiple inheritance is that there are many more arrows to follow. This means that ambigutity is also possible. Can you find the two ambiguous dispatches in this diagram?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-single-ambig.png", dpi = 300)
```

And of course you can combine multiple dispatch with multiple inheritance:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

However, as the method graph gets more and more complicated it gets harder and harder to predict which actual method will get called given a combination of inputs, and it gets harder and harder to make sure that you haven't introduced ambiguity. For that reason I recommend using either multiple dispatch or multiple inheritance with extreme care, and I highly recommend avoiding the combination of the two.

### Other

"MISSING"

It's also possible to dispatch on `...` under special circumstances. See `?dotsMethods` for more details.

## S3 and base types

### `setClass()`

In `slots` and `contains` you can use S4 classes, S3 classes registered with `setOldClass()`, or the implicit class of a base type. In `slots` you can also use the special class `ANY` which does not restrict the input.

If an S4 object contains (inherits from) an S3 class or a base type, it will have a special `.Data` slot which contains the underlying base type or S3 object: \indexc{.Data}

```{r}
RangedNumeric <- setClass(
  "RangedNumeric",
  contains = "numeric",
  slots = list(min = "numeric", max = "numeric")
)
rn <- RangedNumeric(1:10, min = 1, max = 10)
rn@min
rn@.Data
```

S3Part

### `setGeneric()`

The `setGeneric` function provides two main ways to create a new generic.  You can either convert an existing function to a generic function, or you can create a new one from scratch.

```R
sides <- function (object) 0
setGeneric("sides")
# [1] "sides"
```

If you create your own, the second argument to `setGeneric` should be a function that defines all the arguments that you want to dispatch on and contains a call to `standardGeneric`:

```R
setGeneric("sides", function (object) standardGeneric("sides") )
# [1] "sides"
```

### `setMethod()`

You can also use basic classes like `numeric`, `character` and `matrix`. A matrix of (e.g.) characters will have class `matrix`.

```
setGeneric("type", function (x) standardGeneric("type"))
# [1] "type"
setMethod("type", "matrix", function (x) "matrix")
# [1] "type"
setMethod("type", "character", function (x) "character")
# [1] "type"
    
type(letters)
# [1] "character"
type(matrix(letters, ncol = 2))
# [1] "matrix"
```

You can also dispatch on S3 classes provided that you have made S4 aware of them by calling `setOldClass`.

```R
foo <- structure(list(x = 1), class = "foo")
type(foo)

setOldClass("foo")
setMethod("type", "foo", function(x) "foo")
    
type(foo)
# Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : 
#   unable to find an inherited method for function ‘type’ for signature ‘"foo"’ 

setMethod("+", c(e1 = "foo", e2 = "numeric"), function (e1, e2) {
  structure(list(x = e1$x + e2), class = "foo")
})
foo + 3
```
