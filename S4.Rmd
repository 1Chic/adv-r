# S4

The S4 system takes the same basic ideas as S3 and turns the rigour and strictness up to 11. There are three main differences between S3 and S4:

* S4 has formal class definitions. To define a class you call `setClass()` 
  specifying the structure and parent class. 
  
* Rather than attributes or named elements, the components of an S4 objects 
  are called __slots__ and are accessed with a special operator, `@`.
  
* Instead of using a naming convention to define methods, you use
  `setMethod()`
  
It's not possible to cover all of S4 in one chapter. Instead, we'll focus on the basics, what you need to know to write or read most S4 code. To learn more, some good references are:

* [S4 system development in Bioconductor][S4-bioconductor], by Patrick Aboyoun.

* [S4 questions on stackoverflow][SO-Morgan] answered by Martin Morgan.

* [_Software for Data Analysis_][S4DA] by John Chambers.

All functions related to S4 lives in the methods package. This package is always available when you're running R interactively, but may not be available when running R in batch mode (i.e. from `Rscript`). For this reason, it's a good idea to include an explicit `library(methods)` whenever you use S4. This also signals to the reader that you'll be using S4.

```{r setup}
library(methods)
```

## Classes

Unlike S3, S4 classes have a formal definition. An S4 class has three key properties:

* A __name__: an alphanumeric class identifier. By convention, S4 class names
  use UpperCamelCase.

* A named list of __slots__ (fields), which provides slot names and their
  permitted classes. For example, a person class might be represented by a
  character name and a numeric age: `list(name = "character", age = "numeric")`.
  \index{slots}

* A string giving the class it inherits from, or, in S4 terminology,
  that it __contains__. You can provide multiple classes for multiple
  inheritance, but this is an advanced technique which adds much
  complexity.
  
To create a class, you call `setClass()`, supplying these three arguments. Lets make this concrete with an example. Here we create two classes: a person has character name and numeric age, and an employee inherits slots and behaviour from person, adding an additional boss slot that must be a person.

```{r}
setClass("Person", slots = list(name = "character", age = "numeric"))
setClass("Employee", contains = "Person", slots = list(boss = "Person"))
```

The `setClass()` function has 10 other arguments, but they are all either deprecated or not recommended. If you have existing S4 code that uses them, I'd recommend carefully reading the documentation and upgrading to modern practice.

Once you have defined the class, you can create an object from that class by calling `new()`. The first argument is the name of the class, followed by name-value pairs specifying the values of the slots.

```{r}
hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = 37)
hadley
```

Note that there's some tension between the usual interactive functional style of R and the global side-effect causing S4 class definitions. In most programming languages, class definition occurs at compile-time, while object instantiation occurs at run-time - it's unusual to be able to create new classes interactively. This makes it possible to create invalid objects if you are experimenting with class structure interactively:

```{r, error = TRUE}
setClass("A", slots = list(x = "numeric"))
a <- new("A", x = 10)

setClass("A", slots = list(y = "numeric"))
a
```

### Introspection

S3 objects are just built on top of R objects that you're already familiar with, so you can use the tools that you're already familiar with to look inside them and pull out the data you need. `str()` continues to be useful for S4 objects, but there are new set of functions that are helpful for S4 objects.

To access the slots, use `@` or `slot()`. `@` is equivalent to `$`, and `slot()` to `[[`. \index{subsetting!S4} \index{S4|subsetting}

```{r}
hadley@age
slot(hadley, "age")
```

You can list all available slots with `slotNames()`:

```{r}
slotNames(hadley)
```

As a user, you should generally not extract values out of an object using `@`. The names of the slots are considered an internal implementation detail and may change without warning. Instead, look for a method that provides the information you want, and only access the slot directly if there's no other choice.

Use `is()` with one argument to list all classes that an object inherits from. Use `is()` with two arguments to test if an object inherits from a specific class.

```{r}
is(hadley)
is(hadley, "person")
```

### Helper and validators

`new()` serves as a low-level constructor, but it's still often useful to define your own validator and helper functions. I do not recommend using the built-in `setValidity()` function to define a validity method. It is always run by `new()`, which means that you no longer have a cheap way to create objects if you already know the values are valid. 

There are a couple of reasons you might want to provide a helper method for the `Person()` class: to specify default values, and to check the _length_ of the inputs. If you don't supply values, `new()` will use a default value for the slot class:

```{r}
new("Person")
```

And while it is not possible to create a S4 object with the wrong slots or of the wrong type:

```{r, error = TRUE}
new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = "thirty")
new("Person", name = "Hadley", sex = "male")
```

You can create S4 slots with the wrong length:

```{r}
new("Person", age = 1:10)
```

We can avoid both these problems by providing an `initialize()` method. You'll learn more about the details of `setMethod()` in the next section.

```{r, error = TRUE}
setMethod("initialize", "Person", function(.Object, name, age = NA_real_, ...) {
  stopifnot(length(name) == 1)
  stopifnot(length(age) == 1)
  
  .Object@name <- name
  .Object@age <- age
  
  callNextMethod(.Object, ...)
})
```

In your `intialize()` method you should provide named arguments for the slots that you want to check, or provide better defaults for. You should also provide `...` and pass that to `callNextMethod()`. That's important if you want to allow subclasses to use your initialize method.

This doesn't work inside knitr for some reason:

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Name is now reqiured
new("Person")

# And must be length 1
new("Person", name = letters)

# Age now gets a default value of NA
new("Person", name = "Hadley")
```


## Generics and methods

The job of a generic is to perform method dispatch, i.e. find the function designed to work specifically for the given class. S4 generics have a similar structure to S3 generics, with a little more formalism. To create an new S4 generic, you call `setGeneric()` providing a function that calls `standardGeneric()`.   \index{S4!generics} \index{S4!methods} \index{generics!S4} \index{methods!S4}

```{r}
setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) {
  standardGeneric("myGeneric")
})
```

Like `setClass()`, `setGeneric()` has many other arguments, all of which you should never use. Consult the documentation for details.

A generic isn't useful without some methods, and in S4 you add methods with `setMethod()`. You give it the name of the generic, the name of the class, and then the implementation of method,

```{r}
setMethod("myGeneric", "myClass", function(x) {
  # method implementation
})
```

The class can be a (named) vector, which allows S4 to implement multiple dispatch. We'll come back to that later.

And again, `setMethod()` has other arguments, but you should never use them.

```{r}
showMethods("myGeneric")
```

## Method dispatch 

If an S4 generic dispatches on a single class with a single parent, then S4 method dispatch is the same as S3 dispatch. The main difference is how you set up default values: S4 uses the special class `ANY` to match any class and "missing" to match a missing argument. (We'll come back to those later.)

The complexity in S4 dispatch comes from multiple dispatch, because an S4 generic can use the class of multiple arguments to choose the method. To make the ideas in this section concrete, we'll create a simple class structure. We have three classes, a base class C, B which inherits from C, and A which inherits from B. 

```{r}
setClass("C", slots = c(x = "numeric"))
setClass("B", contains = "C")
setClass("A", contains = "B")
```

This creates a class graph that looks like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/class-graph-1.png", dpi = 220)
```

Next, we create a generic, `f()`, which will dispatch on two arguments, `x` and `y`. We'll also initialise one object each from our three classes:

```{r}
setGeneric("f", function(x, y) {
  standardGeneric("f")
})

a <- new("A")
b <- new("B")
c <- new("C")
```

To predict which method a generic will dispatch to, you need to know:

* the name and arguments to the generic
* the signatures of the methods
* the class of arguments supplied to the generic

The simplest type of method dispatch occurs if there's an exact match between the class of arguments (__arg-classes__) and the class of the signature (__sig-classes__). In the following example, we define methods with sig-classes `c("C", "C")` and `c("A", "A")`, and then call them with arg classes `c("C", "C")` and `c("A", "A")`.

```{r}
setMethod("f", c("C", "C"), function(x, y) "c-c")
setMethod("f", c("A", "B"), function(x, y) "a-b")
setMethod("f", c("B", "A"), function(x, y) "b-a")

f(c, c)
f(a, b)
f(b, a)
```


If there isn't an exact match, R looks for the closest method. The distance between the sig-class and arg-class is the sum of the distances between each class (matched by name and excluding `...`). The distance between classes is the shortest distance between them in the class graph. For example, the distance A -> B is 1, A -> C is 2 and B -> C is 1. The distances C -> B, C -> A and B -> A are all infinite because there's no way to reach them. That means that both of the following calls will dispatch to the same method:

```{r}
f(b, c)
f(c, b)
```

What if multiple methods have the same distance? In the following example, two methods the same distance (1 = 1 + 0 = 0 + 1), and there is not a unique closest method. In this situation R gives a warning and calls the method that comes first alphabetically.  This is warning is for you, the developer. You'll need to provide a more specific method to relieve the ambiguity.

```{r, error = TRUE}
f(a, a)
```

Multiple inheritance makes ambiguity even more likely. If we added another class, BC, that inherited from both B and C, then this class would have distance one to both B and C, and distance two to A. As you can see, multiple inheritance makes determining the distance substantially more complex, and is best to avoid unless absolutely necessary.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/class-graph-2.png", dpi = 220)
```

There are two special classes that can be used in the signature: `missing` and `ANY`. `missing` matches the case where the argument is not supplied, and `ANY` is used for setting up default methods. `ANY` has the lowest possible precedence in method matching - in other words, it has a distance value higher than any other parent class.

```{r}
setMethod("f", c("C", "ANY"), function(x,y) "C-*")
setMethod("f", c("C", "missing"), function(x,y) "C-?")

setClass("D", contains = "character")
d <- new("D", "d")

f(c)
f(c, d)
```


This section describes the strategy for matching a call to a generic function to the correct method. If there's an exact match between the class of the objects in the call, and the signature of a method, it's easy - the generic function just calls that method.  Otherwise, R will figure out the method using the following method:

* For each argument to the function, calculate the distance between the 
  arg-class and the sig-class. 

* Compute the total distance by adding together the individual distances.

* Compute this distance for every method. If there's a method with a unique
  smallest distance, use that. Otherwise, give a warning and call the matching
  method that comes first alphabetically.


It's also possible to dispatch on `...` under special circumstances. See `?dotsMethods` for more details.

Finally, there are two methods that find which method gets called given the specification of a generic call:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# From methods: takes generic name and class names
selectMethod("nobs", list("mle"))

# From pryr: takes an unevaluated function call
method_from_call(nobs(fit))
```


## S3 and base types

### `setClass()`

In `slots` and `contains` you can use S4 classes, S3 classes registered with `setOldClass()`, or the implicit class of a base type. In `slots` you can also use the special class `ANY` which does not restrict the input.

If an S4 object contains (inherits from) an S3 class or a base type, it will have a special `.Data` slot which contains the underlying base type or S3 object: \indexc{.Data}

```{r}
RangedNumeric <- setClass(
  "RangedNumeric",
  contains = "numeric",
  slots = list(min = "numeric", max = "numeric")
)
rn <- RangedNumeric(1:10, min = 1, max = 10)
rn@min
rn@.Data
```

S3Part

### `setGeneric()`

The `setGeneric` function provides two main ways to create a new generic.  You can either convert an existing function to a generic function, or you can create a new one from scratch.

```R
sides <- function (object) 0
setGeneric("sides")
# [1] "sides"
```

If you create your own, the second argument to `setGeneric` should be a function that defines all the arguments that you want to dispatch on and contains a call to `standardGeneric`:

```R
setGeneric("sides", function (object) standardGeneric("sides") )
# [1] "sides"
```

### `setMethod()`

You can also use basic classes like `numeric`, `character` and `matrix`. A matrix of (e.g.) characters will have class `matrix`.

```
setGeneric("type", function (x) standardGeneric("type"))
# [1] "type"
setMethod("type", "matrix", function (x) "matrix")
# [1] "type"
setMethod("type", "character", function (x) "character")
# [1] "type"
    
type(letters)
# [1] "character"
type(matrix(letters, ncol = 2))
# [1] "matrix"
```

You can also dispatch on S3 classes provided that you have made S4 aware of them by calling `setOldClass`.

```R
foo <- structure(list(x = 1), class = "foo")
type(foo)

setOldClass("foo")
setMethod("type", "foo", function(x) "foo")
    
type(foo)
# Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : 
#   unable to find an inherited method for function ‘type’ for signature ‘"foo"’ 

setMethod("+", c(e1 = "foo", e2 = "numeric"), function (e1, e2) {
  structure(list(x = e1$x + e2), class = "foo")
})
foo + 3
```


### Exercises

1.  Which S4 generic has the most methods defined for it? Which S4 class 
    has the most methods associated with it?

1.  What happens if you define a new S4 class that doesn't "contain" an 
    existing class?  (Hint: read about virtual classes in `?setClass`.)

1.  What happens if you pass an S4 object to an S3 generic? What happens 
    if you pass an S3 object to an S4 generic? (Hint: read `?setOldClass` 
    for the second case.)
