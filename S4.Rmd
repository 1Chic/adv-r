# S4

The S4 system takes the same basic ideas as S3 but provides a rigorous and strict implementation. There are three main differences between S3 and S4:

* S4 classes have formal definitions provided by a call to `setClass()`.
  An S4 class can have multiple parent classes.
  
* The fields of an S4 object don't use attributes or named elements, but 
  instead are called __slots__ and are accessed with the special `@` operator.
  
* Methods are not defined with a naming convention, but are instead
  defined by a call to `setMethod()`. S4 methods can dispatch on multiple
  arguments.
  
S4 is a rich system, and it's not possible to cover all of it in one chapter. Instead, we'll focus on what you need to know to write or read most S4 code, avoiding discussion of esoterica. To learn more, some good references are:

* [S4 system development in Bioconductor][S4-bioconductor], a slide deck
  by Patrick Aboyoun.

* [S4 questions on stackoverflow][SO-Morgan] answered by Martin Morgan.

* [_Software for Data Analysis_][S4DA], a book by John Chambers.

All functions related to S4 live in the methods package. This package is always available when you're running R interactively, but may not be available when running R in batch mode (i.e. from `Rscript`). For this reason, it's a good idea to call `library(methods)` whenever you use S4. This also signals to the reader that you'll be using the S4 object system.

```{r setup}
library(methods)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Hide annoying output
setMethod <- function(...) invisible(methods::setMethod(...))
setGeneric <- function(...) invisible(methods::setGeneric(...))
```

## Classes

Unlike S3, S4 classes have a formal definition. To define an S4 class, you must define key properties:

* The class __name__. By convention, S4 class names use UpperCamelCase.

* A named list that describes the names and classes of the __slots__ (fields).
  For example, a person class might be represented by a character name and a 
  numeric age: `list(name = "character", age = "numeric")`. The special 
  "ANY" allows objects of any type. \index{slots}

* A string giving the class it inherits from, or, in S4 terminology,
  that it __contains__. You can provide multiple classes for multiple
  inheritance, but this is an advanced technique which adds much
  complexity.

S4 objects can inherit from and include as slots base types and S3 classes. We'll come back to the details at the end of the chapter.

To create a class, you call `setClass()`, supplying these three properties. 

Lets make this concrete with an example. Here we create two classes: a person has character `name` and numeric `age`, and an employee inherits slots and methods from `Person`, adding an additional `boss` slot that must be a `Person`.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
setClass("Person", slots = list(name = "character", age = "numeric"))
setClass("Employee", contains = "Person", slots = list(boss = "Person"))
```

`setClass()` has 10 other arguments, but they are all either deprecated or not recommended. If you have existing S4 code that uses them, I'd recommend carefully reading the documentation and upgrading to modern practice.

Once you have defined the class, you can create an object from that class by calling the collector constructor `new()`. The first argument is the name of the class, and the remaining named arguments specify the values of the slots.

```{r}
hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = 37)
hadley
```

In most programming languages, class definition occurs at compile-time, while object instantiation occurs at run-time. In R, however, both definition and construction occurs at run time. When you call `setClass()`, you are registering a class definition in a (hidden) global variable. As with all state-modifying functions you need to use `setClass()` with care. This isn't usually a problem, because you'll define a class once, then leave the definition alone. However, if you're experimenting with the class defintion interactively, it's possible to create invalid objects:

```{r, error = TRUE}
setClass("A", slots = list(x = "numeric"))
a <- new("A", x = 10)

setClass("A", slots = list(a_different_slot = "numeric"))
a
```

To avoid this problem in production code, you may want to "seal" the class:

```{r, error = TRUE}
setClass("Sealed", sealed = TRUE)
setClass("Sealed")
```

### Initialize method

`new()` serves as a low-level constructor so you don't need to write one yourself. However, the default behaviour has two drawbacks:

*   The default If you don't supply values, `new()` will use a default value for the slot class:

    ```{r}
    new("Person")
    ```
    
    For this class, you might prefer that `name` is always required, and that
    `age` defaults to `NA`.
    
*   It's not possible to create a S4 object with the wrong slots or 
    slots of the wrong type:

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = "thirty")
    new("Person", name = "Hadley", sex = "male")
    ```
    
    But it is possible to create slots with the wrong lengths:
    
    ```{r}
    new("Person", age = 1:10)
    ```

We can override these defaults by providing an `initialize()` method. You'll learn more about the details of creating methods with `setMethod()` in the next section, but in brief, the following code defines a `Person` method for the `intialize` generic.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
setMethod("initialize", "Person", function(.Object, name, age = NA_real_, ...) {
  stopifnot(length(name) == 1)
  stopifnot(length(age) == 1)
  
  .Object@name <- name
  .Object@age <- age
  
  callNextMethod(.Object, ...)
})
```

In your `intialize()` method you should provide named arguments for the slots that you want to check, or provide defaults for. __You__ are then responsible for setting those values with `@`. You should also provide `...` and pass that on to `callNextMethod()`. That will allow future subclasses to use your initialize method.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Name is now reqiured
new("Person")

# And must be length 1
new("Person", name = letters)

# And if not supplied, age gets a default value of NA
new("Person", name = "Hadley")
```

### Helper

As in S3, it's not necessary to provide a helper function, but you should if it's more natural to construct the object some other. For example, you could imagine creating a S4 representation of factors. There you still want to supply a `Factor()` helper that most people would use to construct the object.

```{r}
setClass("Factor", 
  slots = list(levels = "character"),
  contains = "integer"
)

Factor <- function(x, levels = unique(x)) {
  ind <- match(x, levels)
  new("Factor", ind, levels = levels)
}
```

This uses another form of `new()`: unnnamed arguments are taken to be objects of the superclass, which in this case is the base integer type.

### Validator

It's possible to use the built-in `setValidity()` function to define a validity method. However, I do not recommend using this because it is always run by `new()`. If your validation method is expensive, this means that you no longer have a cheap way to create objects when you already know the values are valid. 

Following the factor example, we could port out S3 `validate_factor()` function to an S4 `validateFactor()` function. There are two main differences: we use camelCase instead of snake_case for the function name, and we use `@` instead of `attr()` to access the fields of the object. Note the use of the special `.Data` slot: this only exists when you inherit from an S3 class or base type, and it allows you to get that underlying object.

```{r}
validateFactor <- function(x) {
  values <- x@.Data
  
  if (!all(!is.na(values) & values > 0)) {
    stop(
      "All `x` values must be non-missing and greater than zero",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }
  
  if (length(x@levels) < max(values)) {
    stop(
      "There must at least as many `levels` as possible values in `x`",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }
  
  x
}
```

### Introspection

`str()` and `View()` (in RStudio), continue to be useful tools for inspecting complex S4 object. But you'll also need to learn some new tools. To access the slots, use `@` or `slot()`; `@` is equivalent to `$`, and `slot()` to `[[`. \index{subsetting!S4} \index{S4|subsetting}

```{r}
hadley@age
slot(hadley, "age")
```

You can list all available slots with `slotNames()`:

```{r}
slotNames(hadley)
```

(Internally, slots are implemented as attributes, so you can also use `attributes()` to get a glimpse of all the components at once. This isn't recommended, however, as it's an internal implementation detail and hence a bad idea to rely on it.)

As a user, you should generally not extract values out of an object using `@`. The names of the slots are considered an internal implementation detail and may change without warning. Instead, look for a method that provides the information you want, and only access the slot directly if there's no other choice.

To determine what classes an object inherits from, use `is()`:

```{r}
is(hadley)
```

To test if an object inherits from a specific class, use the second argument of `is()`:

```{r}
is(hadley, "person")
```

## Generics and methods

The job of a generic is to perform method dispatch, i.e. find the method designed for the combination of classes passed to the generic. Here you'll learn how to define S4 generics and methods, then in the next section we'll dive into some of the details of S4 method dispatch. 

S4 generics have a similar structure to S3 generics, with a little more formalism. To create an new S4 generic, you call `setGeneric()` providing a function that calls `standardGeneric()`. \index{S4!generics} \index{S4!methods} \index{generics!S4} \index{methods!S4}.

```{r}
setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) {
  standardGeneric("myGeneric")
})
```

Like `setClass()`, `setGeneric()` has many other arguments, none of which you should ever need to use. Consult the documentation for details.

A generic isn't useful without some methods, and in S4 you add methods with `setMethod()`. There are three important arguments: the name of the generic, the name of the class, and the method itself. (Again `setMethod()` has other arguments, but you should never use them.)

```{r}
setMethod("myGeneric", "Person", function(x) {
  # method implementation
})
```

As with S3, the most commonly defined method controls how the object is printed. In S4, however, this method is called "show". When defining a method for an existing generic, you need first determine the arguments. You can you get those from the documentation or by looking at the formals of the generic. Unlike S3, if you get them wrong, `setMethod()` will tell you. 

```{r}
names(formals(show))
```

Here we define a show method for Person, in order to improve the default output. 

```{r}
setMethod("show", "Person", function(object) {
  cat("Person\n")
  cat("  Name: ", object@name, "\n", sep = "")
  cat("  Age:  ", object@age, "\n", sep = "")
})
hadley
```

More formally, the second argument to `setMethod()` is called the __signature__. In S4, unlike S3, the signature can include multiple arguments. This makes method dispatch substantially more complicated, but avoids having to implement double-dispatch as a special case. We'll talk more about multiple dispatch in the next section.

### Introspection

Use `.S4methods` to list all the methods that belong to a generic, or that are associated with a class.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
.S4methods("initialize")
.S4methods(class = "Person")
```

If you're looking for the source for a specific method, you can use `selectMethod()`. You give it the name of the generic, and the class signature.

```{r}
selectMethod("show", "Person")
```

If you're using a method defined in a package, the easiest way to get help on it, is to construct a valid call, and then put `?` in front it. `?` will use the arguments to figure out which help file you need:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?show(hadley)
```

## Method dispatch 

S4 dispatch is complicated because S4 for two reasons:

* Multiple inheritance, i.e. a class can have multiple parents, 
* Multiple dispatch, i.e. a generic can use multiple arguments to pick a method. 

These features make S4 very powerful, but can also make it hard to understand which method will get selected for a given combination of inputs. 

To explain method dispatch, we'll start simple with single inheritance and single dispatch, and work out way up to the more complicated cases. To illustrate the ideas without getting bogged down in the details, we'll use an imaginary __class graph__ that uses emoji:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-emoji.png", dpi = 300)
```

Emoji give us very compact class names (just one symbol) that evoke the relationships between the classes. It should be straightfoward to remember that `r emo::ji("stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye")` inherits from `r emo::ji("wink")` which inherits from `r emo::ji("no_mouth")`, and that `r emo::ji("sunglasses")` inherits from both `r emo::ji("dark_sunglasses")` and `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")`

### Single dispatch

Let's start with the simplest case: a generic function that dispatch on a single object that has a single parent. The method dispatch rules here are simple, and the same as S3, but this will serve to define the graphical conventions we'll expand to more complex cases.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single.png", dpi = 300)
```

There are two parts to this diagram:

* The top part `f(...)` defines the scope of the diagram. Here we have a 
  generic with one argument, and we're going to explore method dispatch for a
  class heirarchy that is three levels deep. We'll only ever look at a small
  fragment of the complete class graph. This will help you build intutition
  that you can then apply in more complex scenarios.
  
* The bottom part is the __method graph__ and  displays all possible methods 
  that could be defined. Methods that have been defined 
  (i.e. with `setMethod()`) have a grey background.

To find the method that gets called, you start with the class of the actual arguments, then follow the arrows until you find a method that exists. For example, if you called the function with an object of class `r emo::ji("wink")` you would follow the arrow right to find the method defined for the more general `r emo::ji("no_mouth")` class. If no method is found, method dispatch has failed and you get an error. For this reason, class graphs should usually have methods defined for all the terminal nodes, those on the far right. 

Note that the classes are arranged in a different order in the class graph and the method graph. in different orders in the generic call vs. the method list. This is because you understand a class hierarchy by moving from the generic to the specific, but method dispatch looks for the most specific, before looking for the more general.

There are two pseudo-classes that you can define methods for. These classes don't actually exist, but allow you define fallback methods. The first pseudo-class is  "ANY". This pseudo-class matches any class, so plays the same role as the `default` pseudo-class in S3. For technical reasons that we'll get to later, the link to the "ANY" method is longer than the links between the other classes:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-any.png", dpi = 300)
```

The second pseudo-class is "MISSING". If you define a method for this "class", it will match whenever the argument is missing. It's generally not useful for function that take a single argument, but can be used for functions like `+` and `-` that behave differently depending on whether they have one or two arguments.

### Multiple inheritance

Things get more complicated when one of the classes has multiple parents.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

The basic process of dispatch remains the same. You start from the actual class supplied to the generic, then follow the arrows until you find a method that exists. The wrinkle is now that there are multiple arrows to follow, so you might find multiple methods. If that happens, you pick the method that is closest, i.e. requires travelling the fewest arrows. 

What happens if methods are the same distance? For example, imagined we've defined methods for `r emo::ji("dark_sunglasses")` and `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")`, and we call the generic with `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-ambig.png", dpi = 300)
```

This is called an __ambiguous__ method, and in diagrams I'll illustrate it with a thick dotted border. When this happens in R, you'll get a warning, and one of the two methods is basically picked at random (it uses the method that comes first in the alphabet). When you discover ambiguity you should always resolve it by providing a more precise method:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-ambig-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

The fallback "ANY" method still exists but the rules are little more complex. As indicated by the wavy dotted lines, the "ANY" method is always considered further away than method for a real class. This means that it will never contribute to ambiguity.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-any.png", dpi = 300)
```

It is hard to simultaneously preventing ambiguity, ensure that every terminal method has an implementation, and minimise the number of define methods (in order to actual benefit from method dispatch). For example, of the six ways to define only two methods for this call, only one is free from problems. For this reason, I recommend using multiple inheritance with extreme care; you will need to carefully think about the method graph and plan carefully.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-all.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Multiple dispatch

Once you understand dispatch for multiple inheritance, understanding inheritance for multiple dispatch is straightforwards. The following method graph extends the existing notation for multiple inheritance. Now each method is specified by two classes (separated by a comma), and we draw an arrow whenever either class would have an arrow, if by itself.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-single.png", dpi = 300)
```

I'm not going to show examples of dispatching on more than two arguments, but you can follow the basic principles to generate your own method graphs.

The main difference between multiple inheritance and multiple dispatch is that there are many more arrows to follow. The following diagram shows four defined methods produce two ambiguous cases:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-single-ambig.png", dpi = 300)
```

Multiple dispatch tends to be less tricky to work with than multiple inheritance because are usually fewer terminal class combinations. In this example, there's only one.

## Multiple dispatch and multiple inheritance

Of course you can combine multiple dispatch with multiple inheritance:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

The most complicated case dispatches on two classes both of which have mulitple inheritance:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

However, as the method graph gets more and more complicated it gets harder and harder to predict which actual method will get called given a combination of inputs, and it gets harder and harder to make sure that you haven't introduced ambiguity. I highly recommend avoiding the combination of the two. There are some techniques (like mixins) that allow you to tame this complexity, but I am not aware of a detailed treatment as applied to S4.

## S4 and existing code

Most code that uses S4 will have to interact with existing S3 classes and base types, and with existing functions, including existing S3 generics. This section describes how S4 classes, methods, and generics interacts with existing code.

### Classes

In `slots` and `contains` you can use S4 classes, S3 classes, or the implicit class of a base type.  To use an S3 class, you must first register it with `setOldClass()`. You call this function once for each S3 class, giving it the class attribute. For example, the following defintions are already provided by base R:

```{r, eval = FALSe}
setOldClass("data.frame")
setOldClass(c("ordered", "factor"))
setOldClass(c("glm", "lm"))
```

Generally, these definitions should be provided by the creator of the S3 class. If you're trying to build an S4 class on top of a S3 class provided by a package, it is better to request that the package maintainer to add this call to the package, rather than running it yourself. 

If an S4 object inherits from an S3 class or a base type, it will have a special virtual slot called `.Data`. This contains the underlying base type or S3 object: \indexc{.Data}

```{r}
RangedNumeric <- setClass(
  "RangedNumeric",
  contains = "numeric",
  slots = list(min = "numeric", max = "numeric")
)
rn <- RangedNumeric(1:10, min = 1, max = 10)
rn@min
rn@.Data
```

It is possible to define S3 methods for S4 generics, and S4 methods for S3 generics (provided you've called `setOldClass()`). However, it's more complicated that it might appear at first glance, so make sure you thoroughly read `?Methods_for_S3`.
