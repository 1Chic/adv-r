## Introduction

This chapter summarises the most important data types in base R: the vector types. You've probably used many (if not all) of the vectors before, but you may not have thought deeply about how they are interrelated. In this brief overview, I won't discuss individual types in depth. Instead, I'll show you how they fit together as a whole. If you need more details, you can find them in R's documentation.

Vectors come in two flavours: atomic vectors and lists. They differ in the types of their elements: all elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types. Closely related to vectors is `NULL`; `NULL` is not a vector, but often serves the role of a generic 0-length vector.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/summary-tree.png", dpi = 300)
```

Every vector can also have __attributes__, which you can think of as a named list containing arbitrary metadata. Two attributes are particularly important because they create important vector variants. The **dim**ension attribute turns vectors into matrices and arrays. The __class__ attribute powers the S3 object system, which you'll learn how to use in Chapter \@ref(s3). Here, you'll learn about a handful of the most important S3 vectors: factors, date/times, data frames, and tibbles.

Almost all other objects are built upon these foundations. In [base types], you'll learn more about that foundation, and then in [S3] you'll see how you can make your own extensions.

### Quiz {-}

Take this short quiz to determine if you need to read this chapter. If the answers quickly come to mind, you can comfortably skip this chapter. You can check your answers in [answers](#data-structure-answers).

1. What are the four common types of atomic vectors? What are the two 
   rare types?

1. What are attributes? How do you get them and set them?

1. How is a list different from an atomic vector? How is a matrix different
   from a data frame?

1. Can you have a list that is a matrix? Can a data frame have a column 
   that is a matrix?
   
1. How do tibbles behave differently from data frames?

### Outline {-}

[update]{.todo}

* [Vectors](#vectors) introduces you to atomic vectors and lists, R's 1d 
  data structures.
  
* [Attributes](#attributes) takes a small detour to discuss attributes,
  R's flexible metadata specification. Here you'll learn about factors,
  an important data structure created by setting attributes of an atomic 
  vector.
  
* [Matrices and arrays](#matrices-and-arrays) introduces matrices and arrays,
  data structures for storing 2d and higher dimensional data.
  
* [Data frames](#data-frames) teaches you about the data frame, the most
  important data structure for storing data in R. Data frames combine 
  the behaviour of lists and matrices to make a structure ideally suited for
  the needs of statistical data.

## Atomic vectors
\index{atomic vectors} 
\index{vectors!atomic|see{atomic vectors}}
\indexc{NA}
\indexc{c()} 

There are four common types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double, and character, and collectively integer and double vectors are known as numeric[^numeric]. There are two rare types that I will not discuss further: complex and raw. Complex numbers are rarely need for statistics, and raw vectors are special type needed to work with binary data. Each of the four primiary atomic vectors has some special syntax to create individual pieces:

* Strings are surrounded by `"` (`"hi"`) or `'` (`'bye'`).

* Doubles can be specific in decimal form (`0.1234`), 
  scientific form (`1.23e4`), or hex form (`0xcafe`). Additionally,
  doubles have three special values: `Inf`, `-Inf`, and `NaN`.
  
* Integers are written similarly to doubles but must be followed by `L` 
  (`1234L`, `1e4L`, or ), and can not include decimals.

* Logicals can be spelled out (`TRUE` or `FALSE`), or abbreviated.

Each atomic vector also has its own missing value: `NA` (logical), `NA_integer_` (integer), `NA_real_` (double), and `NA_character_` (charater). You don't usually need to know about the special types since, as you'll learn shortly, whenver you use `NA` with other values, it will be coerced to the correct type.

[^numeric]: This is a slight simplification as R does not use "numeric" consistently, which we'll come back to in Section \@ref(numeric-type).

I'll often use __scalar__ to refer to indiviudal values, like `TRUE` or `1`. This is a bit of a simplification: they're really vectors of length 1. However, scalar is a convenient word, even if it's not completely true to the underlying relatively.

You'll often use `c()` vectors of length greater than one with `c()`:

```{r}
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
log_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
chr_var <- c("these are", "some strings")
```

Throughout the book, I'll draw vectors as connected rectangles, so the above code could be drawn as follows:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/atomic.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Types and tests
\indexc{typeof()}

Given a vector, you can determine its type with `typeof()`, and its length with `length()`. 

Use "is" functions with care. `is.character()`, `is.double()`, `is.integer()`, and `is.logical()` are ok. But the following may be surprising:

* `is.vector()` tests for vectors that have no attributes apart from names.

* `is.atomic()` tests for atomic vectors __or__ NULL.

* `is.numeric()` tests for the numerical-ness of a vector, 
  not whether it's built on top of an integer or double.

See Section \@ref(is-functions) for more detail.

### Coercion
\index{coercion}

All elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, so when you attempt to combine different types they will be __coerced__ to the most flexible one (logical << integer << double << character). For example, combining a character and an integer yields a character:

```{r}
str(c("a", 1))
```

Coercion often happens automatically. Most mathematical functions (`+`, `log`, `abs`, etc.) will coerce to numeric. This particularly useful for logical vectors because `TRUE` becomes 1 and `FALSE` becomes 0.

```{r}
x <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
as.numeric(x)

# Total number of TRUEs
sum(x)

# Proportion that are TRUE
mean(x)
```

Vectorised logical operations (`&`, `|`, `any`, etc) will coerce to a logical, but since this might lose information, it's always accompanied a warning.

You can coerce deliberately by using `as.character()`, `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, or `as.logical()`. Failed coercions from strings generate a warning and a missing value:

```{r}
as.integer(c("1", "1.5", "a"))
```

### Exercises

1. How do you create vectors of type raw and complex? (See `?raw` and 
   `?complex`)

1. Test your knowledge of vector coercion rules by predicting the output of
   the following uses of `c()`:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    c(1, FALSE)
    c("a", 1)
    c(TRUE, 1L)
    ```

1. Why is `1 == "1"` true? Why is `-1 < FALSE` true? Why is `"one" < 2` false?

1. What makes `is.vector()` and `is.numeric()` fundamentally different to
   `is.logical()` and `is.character()`?

1. Why is the default missing value, `NA`, a logical vector? What's special
   about logical vectors? (Hint: think about `c(FALSE, NA_character_)`.)

## Attributes {#attributes}
\index{attributes}
\indexc{attr()}
\indexc{attributes()}
\indexc{structure()}

You might have noticed that the set of atomic vectors does not include a number important vectors like factors and date/times. These types are built on top of atomic vectors by adding attributes to them. In this section, you'll learn the basics of attributes, and in the next section you'll learn about factors and date/times.

### Getting and setting

You can think of attributes as a named list[^pairlist] used to attach metadata to an object. Individual attributes can be retrieved and modified with `attr()`, or you can retrieved en masse with `attributes()`, and set en masse with `structure()`. 

[^pairlist]: The reality is a little more complicated: attributes are actually stored in pairlists, which you can learn more about in [pairlists]. Pairlists are a profoundly different data structure under the hood but behave the same as lists.

```{r}
a <- 1:3
attr(a, "x") <- "abcdef"
attr(a, "y") <- 4:6
str(attributes(a))

# Or equivalently
a <- structure(
  1:3, 
  x = "abcdef",
  y = 4:6
)
str(attributes(a))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/attr.png", dpi = 300)
```

Attributes should generally be thought of as ephemeral (unless they're formalised into an S3 class). For example, most attributes will be lost when you operate on a vector:

```{r}
attributes(a[1])

attributes(sum(a))
```

There are three exceptions for particularly important attributes:

* Names, a character vector giving each element a name.
* Dimensions, an integer vector, used to turn vectors into matrices and arrays.
* Class, a character vector, used to implement the S3 object system.

Each of these attributes has a specially accessor function used to get and set values. When working with these attributes, use `names(x)`, `dim(x)`, and `class(x)`, not `attr(x, "names")`, `attr(x, "dim")`, and `attr(x, "class")`.

### Names {#attr-names}
\index{attributes|names}
\indexc{names()}
\indexc{setNames()}
 
You can name a vector in three ways:

```{r}
# When creating it: 
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

# By setting names() of an existing vector:
x <- 1:3
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Inline, with setNames():
x <- setNames(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```

To be technically correct, when drawing the named vector `x`, I should draw it like so:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/attr-names-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

However, names are so special and so important, that unless I'm trying specifically to draw attention to the attributes data structure, I'll use them to label the vector directly:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/attr-names-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

Names aren't required to be unique. However, character subsetting, described in Section \@ref(lookup-tables), is the most important reason to use names and it is most useful when the names are unique.

Not all elements of a vector need to have a name. Depending on how you create the vector the missing names will be either `""` or `NA_character_`. If all names are missing, `names()` will return `NULL`. You remove names from an existing vector using `unname(x)` or `names(x) <- NULL`.

### Dimensions {#attr-dims}
\index{arrays} 
\index{matrices|see{arrays}}

Adding a `dim` attribute to a vector allows it to behave like a 2-dimensional __matrix__ or multi-dimensional __array__. Matrices and arrays are most useful for mathematical calculations (particularly when fitting models); lists are a better fit for most other programming tasks in R.

You can create matrices and arrays with `matrix()` and `array()`, or by using the assignment form of `dim()`:

```{r}
# Two scalar arguments specify row and column sizes
a <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
a

# One vector argument to describe all dimensions
b <- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2))
b

# You can also modify an object in place by setting dim()
c <- 1:6
dim(c) <- c(3, 2)
c

# Or with structure
structure(1:6, dim = c(2, 3))
```

To be technically correct, the matrix `a` should be drawn like so:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/attr-dim-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

However, dimensions, like names, are special, so it's usually easier to elide this detail and draw matrices as 2d structures:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/attr-dim-2.png", dpi = 300)
```



| Vector            | Matrix                     | Array            |
|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| `names()`         | `rownames()`, `colnames()` | `dimnames()`     |
| `length()`        | `nrow()`, `ncol()`         | `dim()`          |
| `c()`             | `rbind()`, `cbind()`       | `abind::abind()` |
| ---               | `t()`                      | `aperm()`        |
| `is.null(dim(x))` | `is.matrix()`              | `is.array()`     |

In mathematics, vector usually means something one-dimesional


Vectors are technically thought of as 1-dimensional, but actually have a `NULL` dimensions. You also can have matrices with a single row or single column, or arrays with a single dimension. They may print similarly, but will behave differently. The differences aren't too important, but it's useful to know they exist in case you get strange output from a function (`tapply()` is a frequent offender). As always, use `str()` to reveal the differences. \index{arrays!1d}

```{r}
str(1:3)                   # 1d vector
str(matrix(1:3, ncol = 1)) # column vector
str(matrix(1:3, nrow = 1)) # row vector
str(array(1:3, 3))         # "array" vector
```

### Class {#attr-class}


### Exercises

1.  How is `setNames()` implemented?

1.  What does `dim()` return when applied to a vector?
    When might you use `NROW()` or `NCOL()`?

1.  How would you describe the following three objects? What makes them
    different to `1:5`?

    ```{r}
    x1 <- array(1:5, c(1, 1, 5))
    x2 <- array(1:5, c(1, 5, 1))
    x3 <- array(1:5, c(5, 1, 1))
    ```

1.  An early draft used this code to illustrate `structure()`:

    ```{r}
    structure(1:5, comment = "my attribute")
    ```

    But when you print that object you don't see the comment attribute.
    Why? Is the attribute missing, or is there something else special about
    it? (Hint: try using help.) \index{attributes!comment}


## S3 atomic vectors

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/summary-tree-s3-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Factors
\index{factors}
\indexc{stringsAsFactors}
 
One important use of attributes is to define factors. A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values, and is used to store categorical data. Factors are built on top of integer vectors using two attributes: the `class`, "factor", which makes them behave differently from regular integer vectors, and the `levels`, which defines the set of allowed values.

```{r}
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x

typeof(x)
attributes(x)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/factor.png", dpi = 300)
```

Factors are useful when you know the possible values a variable may take, even if you don't see all values in a given dataset. Using a factor instead of a character vector makes it obvious when some groups contain no observations:

```{r}
sex_char <- c("m", "m", "m")
sex_factor <- factor(sex_char, levels = c("m", "f"))

table(sex_char)
table(sex_factor)
```

Unfortunately, many base R functions (like `read.csv()` and `data.frame()`) automatically convert character vectors to factors. This is suboptimal, because there's no way for those functions to know the set of all possible levels or their optimal order: the levels are a property of the experimental design, not the data. Instead, use the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this behaviour, and then manually convert character vectors to factors using your knowledge of the data. 

A global option, `options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)`, is available to control this behaviour, but I don't recommend using it. Changing a global option may have unexpected consequences when combined with other code (either from packages, or code that you're `source()`ing), and global options make code harder to understand because they increase the number of lines you need to read to understand how a single line of code will behave. Instead you might want to consider packages from the tidyverse: they never automatically convert strings to factors.  

While factors look like (and often behave like) character vectors, they are built on top of integers. Be careful when treating them like strings. Some string methods (like `gsub()` and `grepl()`) will coerce factors to strings automatically, while others (like `nchar()`) will throw an error, and still others (like `c()`) will use the underlying integer values. For this reason, it's usually best to explicitly convert factors to character vectors if you need string-like behaviour.

The tidyverse provides the forcats package.

### Date/times {#date-times}

Date, POSIXct, POSIXlt

A little idiosyncratic: unlike factor, there's are no `Date()`, `POSIXct()`, or `POSIXlt()` functions[^isodate], so you must create by coercing from

The tidyverse provides the lubridate package to shim over some of the 

[^isodate]: There are the `ISOdate` and `ISOdatetime()` functions but note that `ISOdate()` returns a POSIXct (not a date), and `ISOdatetime()` works by pasting together all it's inputs, so it's no faster than calling `strptime()`.

### Exercises

1.  What happens to a factor when you modify its levels? 
    
    ```{r, results = FALSE}
    f1 <- factor(letters)
    levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))
    ```

1.  What does this code do? How do `f2` and `f3` differ from `f1`?

    ```{r, results = FALSE}
    f2 <- rev(factor(letters))

    f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters))
    ```


## Lists

Lists are different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type, including lists. You construct lists by using `list()` instead of `c()`: \index{lists} \index{vectors!lists|see{lists}}

```{r}
x <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9))
str(x)
```

Lists can contain complex objects so it's not possible to pick one visual style that works for every list. Generally I'll draw lists like vectors, using colour to remind you of the hierarchy.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/list.png", dpi = 300)
```

Lists are sometimes called __recursive__ vectors, because a list can contain other lists. This makes them fundamentally different from atomic vectors.

```{r}
x <- list(list(list(1)))
str(x)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/list-recursive.png", dpi = 300)
```

`c()` will combine several lists into one. If given a combination of atomic vectors and lists, `c()` will coerce the vectors to lists before combining them. Compare the results of `list()` and `c()`:

```{r}
x <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
y <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(x)
str(y)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/list-c.png", dpi = 300)
```

The `typeof()` a list is `list`. You can test for a list with `is.list()` and coerce to a list with `as.list()`. You can turn a list into an atomic vector with `unlist()`. If the elements of a list have different types, `unlist()` uses the same coercion rules as `c()`.

Lists are used to build up many of the more complicated data structures in R. For example, both data frames (described in [data frames](#data-frames)) and linear models objects (as produced by `lm()`) are lists:

```{r}
is.list(mtcars)

mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
is.list(mod)
```

You'll learn more about that in [S3].

### List-matrices and list-arrays

While atomic vectors are most commonly turned into matrices, the dimension attribute can also be set on lists to make list-matrices or list-arrays: \index{arrays!list-arrays} \index{list-arrays}

```{r}
l <- list(1:3, "a", TRUE, 1.0)
dim(l) <- c(2, 2)
l
```

These are relatively esoteric data structures, but can be useful if you want to arrange objects into a grid-like structure. For example, if you're running models on a spatio-temporal grid, it might be natural to preserve the grid structure by storing the models in a 3d array.

### Exercises

1.  How does a list differ from an atomic vector?

1.  Why do you need to use `unlist()` to convert a list to an 
    atomic vector? Why doesn't `as.vector()` work? 

## `NULL`

Closely related to vectors is `NULL`, a singleton object often used to represent a vector of length 0. 

```{r}
typeof(NULL)
length(NULL)
```

Important to explain here because `c()` returns NULL.

`NULL` does not have attributes.


## S3 lists

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/summary-tree-s3-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Data frames {#data-frames}
\index{data frames}

A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R, and if used systematically makes data analysis easier. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors. This makes it a 2-dimensional structure, so it shares properties of both the matrix and the list.  This means that a data frame has `names()`, `colnames()`, and `rownames()`, although `names()` and `colnames()` are the same thing. The `length()` of a data frame is the length of the underlying list and so is the same as `ncol()`; `nrow()` gives the number of rows. 
As you will learn in Chapter \@ref(subsetting), you can subset a data frame like a 1d structure (where it behaves like a list), or a 2d structure (where it behaves like a matrix).

### Creation

You create a data frame using `data.frame()`, which takes named vectors as input:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
str(df)
```

Beware `data.frame()`'s default behaviour which turns strings into factors. Use `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this behaviour: \indexc{stringsAsFactors}

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(df)
```

Data frames are named lists with attributes providing the (column) `names`, `row.names`, and a class of "data.frame":

```{r}
typeof(df)
attributes(df)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/data-frame-1.png", dpi = 300)
```

But usually these details are not important so I'll draw data frames in the same way as a named list, but arranged to emphaised the columnar structure.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/data-frame-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Testing and coercion

To check if an object is a data frame, use `is.data.frame()`:

```{r}
is.data.frame(df)
```

You can coerce an object to a data frame with `as.data.frame()`:

* A vector will create a one-column data frame.

* A list will create one column for each element; recycling shorter elements
  to the same length as the longest.
  
* A matrix will create a data frame with the same number of columns and 
  rows as the matrix.

### Combining data frames

You can combine data frames using `cbind()` and `rbind()`: \indexc{cbind()} \indexc{rbind()}

```{r}
cbind(df, data.frame(z = 3:1))
rbind(df, data.frame(x = 10, y = "z"))
```

When combining column-wise, the number of rows must match, but row names are ignored. When combining row-wise, both the number and names of columns must match. Use `dplyr::bind_rows()`, `data.table::rbindlist()`, or similar to combine data frames that don't have the same columns. 

It's a common mistake to try and create a data frame by `cbind()`ing vectors together. This is unlikely to do what you want because `cbind()` will create a matrix unless one of the arguments is already a data frame. Instead use `data.frame()` directly:

```{r}
# This is always a mistake
bad <- data.frame(cbind(a = 1:2, b = c("a", "b")))
str(bad)

good <- data.frame(a = 1:2, b = c("a", "b"))
str(good)
```

But, again, beware the default `stringsAsFactors = TRUE`.

### List columns
\index{data frames!list-column}
\index{data frames!matrix-column}
\indexc{I()}

Since a data frame is a list of vectors, it is possible for a data frame to have a column that is a list. This is a powerful technique because a list can contain any other R object. This means that you can have a column of data frames, or model objects, or even functions! 

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3)
df$y <- list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4)
df
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/data-frame-list.png", dpi = 300)
```

However, when a list is given to `data.frame()`, it tries to put each item of the list into its own column, so this fails:

```{r, error = TRUE}
data.frame(x = 1:3, y = list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4))
```

A workaround is to use `I()`, which causes `data.frame()` to treat the list as one unit:

```{r}
dfl <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = I(list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4)))
str(dfl)
```

`I()` adds the `AsIs` class to its input, but this can usually be safely ignored. 

### Matrix and data frame columns

Similarly, it's also possible to have a column of a data frame that's a matrix or array, as long as the number of rows matches the data frame:

```{r}
dfm <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3 * 10, 
  y = I(matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)),
  z = I(data.frame(a = runif(3), b = letters[1:3]))
  )
str(dfm)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-structures/data-frame-matrix.png", dpi = 300)
```

(This requires a slight relaxation of our definition of a data frame: it's not the `length()` of each column that must be equal; it's the `NROW()`)

Use list and array columns with caution. Many functions that work with data frames assume that all columns are atomic vectors, and the printed display can be confusing.

```{r}
dfl[2, ]
dfm[2, ]
```

### Tibbles
\index{tibbles}

Data frames have a number of frustrating behaviours; things that made sense at the time data frames were created but now cause friction. To reduce that frustration, the tidyverse provides a modern reimagining of a data frame, called the tibble.

```{r}
library(tibble)
```

Tibbles like data frames (so you can use them with existing code), but tibbles:

*   Never coerce their inputs. This makes them easier to use with 
    character vectors and lists [^tibble-nrow].
    
    ```{r}
    tibble(
      x = c("one", "two", "three"), 
      y = list(1:3, letters, list())
    )
    ```
*   Have a better print method which (by default) only shows the first 10 rows,
    prints the column types, has better defaults for list columns, and
    thoughtfully format columns for improved readability.
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot2::diamonds
    ```
    
*   Tibbles tweak the behaviour of `[` and `$` to be safer: `[` will always 
    return another tibble (not sometimes a vector), and `$` will warn if a 
    column does not exist (rather than silently returning `NULL`), and
    neither use partial name matching. 
    
    Much historic code uses `df[, "col"]` to extract a single column; switch 
    to the more expressive `df[["col"]]` instead (which works with data frames
    and tibbles).

[^tibble-nrow]: At time of writing, tibbles do not support matrix or data frame columns, but we're working on it, and hopefully they'll work by the time you read this!

I like to describe tibbles as data frames that are lazy and surly: this is a fun way to remember that they don't convert data types or names, and warn if you try and access a non-existant variable.

### Exercises

1.  What attributes does a data frame possess?

1.  What does `as.matrix()` do when applied to a data frame with 
    columns of different types? How does it differ from `data.matrix()`?

1.  Can you have a data frame with 0 rows? What about 0 columns?

## Answers {#data-structure-answers}

1.  The four common types of atomic vector are logical, integer, double 
    (sometimes called numeric), and character. The two rarer types are
    complex and raw.
    
1.  Attributes allow you to associate arbitrary additional metadata to
    any object. You can get and set individual attributes with `attr(x, "y")`
    and `attr(x, "y") <- value`; or get and set all attributes at once with
    `attributes()`.

1.  The elements of a list can be any type (even a list); the elements of 
    an atomic vector are all of the same type. Similarly, every element of 
    a matrix must be the same type; in a data frame, the different columns 
    can have different types.
    
1.  You can make "list-array" by assigning dimensions to a list. You can
    make a matrix a column of a data frame with `df$x <- matrix()`, or
    using `I()` when creating a new data frame `data.frame(x = I(matrix()))`.

1.  Tibbles have an enhanced print method, never coerce strings to factors,
    and provide stricter subsetting methods.
