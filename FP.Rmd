\index{functional programming}

R, at its heart, is a __functional__ language; it has certain technical properties that lead to a style of problem solving centered on creating functions. Below I'll give a brief overview of the technical definition of a functional _language_, but in this book I will primarily focus on the functional _style_ of programming, because I think it is an extremely good fit to the types of problem you commonly encounter when doing data analysis.

Recently, FP techniques have experienced a surge in interest because they are complementary to object oriented programming, the dominant programming paradigm for the last several decades. Since FP functions tend to be pure, they make for programs that are easier to reason about using only local information, and hence often much easier to automatically optimise or parallelise. The traditional weaknesses of FP languages, poorer performance and sometimes unpredictable memory usage, have been much reduced in recent years.

## Functional programming languages {-}

Every programming language has functions, so what makes a programming language functional? There are many conflicting defintions for precisely what that means, but there are two common threads. 

Firstly, functional languages have __first class functions__, functions that behave like any other data structure. In R, this means that you can do anything with a function that you can do with a vector: you can assign them to variables, store them in lists, pass them as arguments to other functions, create them inside functions, and even return them as the result of a function. 

Secondly, many functional languages also required __pure__. A pure function has two important properties:

* The output only depends on the inputs, which implies that if you call it again
  with the same inputs, you get the same outputs.
  
* The function has no side-effects, like changing the value of a variable, 
  writing to disk, or displaying to the screen.

Pure functions are much easier to reason about but obviously have significant downsides: imagine doing a data analysis where you couldn't generate random numbers or read files from disk. This means that strictly speaking, R isn't a functional programming _language_. However, you can certainly adopt a functional style in parts of your code: you don't _have_ to write pure functions, but I think that you often _should_. 

## Functional style {-}

It's hard to describe exactly what a functional _style_ is, but generally I think it means breaking a problem into small pieces and solving each piece with a function or combination of functions. When using a functional style you strive to decompose components of the problem into isolated functions that operate independently. Each function taken by itself is simple and straightforward to understand; complexity is handled by composing fuctions in various ways.

The following three chapters discuss the three key functional techniques that allow you to decompose problems into smaller pieces:

* Chapter \@ref(functionals) shows you how to replace many for loops with 
  __functionals__ which are functions like `lapply()` that take another 
  function as an argument. Functionals allow you to take a function that solves 
  the problem for a single input, and generalise it to handle any number of 
  inputs. Functionals are by far and away the most important technique, and 
  you'll use them all the time in data analysis.

* Chapter \@ref(function-factories) introduces __function factories__, 
  functions that create functions. 

* Chapter \@ref(function-operators) shows you how to create __function
  operators__, functions that take functions as input and produce functions 
  as output. They are like adverbs, because they typically modify the operation 
  of a function.

Collectively, these types of function are caled __higher-order functions__.
