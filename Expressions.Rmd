# Expressions

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

To compute on the language, we first need to understand its structure. That requires some new vocabulary, some new tools, and some new ways of thinking about R code. \index{expressions}

The first thing you'll need to understand is the distinction between an operation and its a result. Take this code, which takes a variable `x` multiplies it by 10 and saves the result to a new variable called `y`. It doesn't work because we haven't defined a variable called `x`:

```{r, error = TRUE}
y <- x * 10
```

It would be nice if we could capture this intent, without doing it. In other words, how can we separate our description of the action from performing it? One way is to use `base::quote()`: it captures an expression without evaluating it: \indexc{quote()}

```{r}
z <- quote(y <- x * 10)
z
```

`quote()` returns a quoted __expression__: an object that contains R code. In this chapter, you'll learn about the structure of those expressions, which will also help you understand how R executes code. Later, we'll learn about `eval()` which allows you to take such an expression and perform, or __evaluate__, it:

```{r}
x <- 4
eval(z)
y
```

## Abstract syntax trees

Quoted expressions are also called an abstract syntax trees (AST) because the structure of code is fundamentally hierarchical and can be naturally represented as a tree. To make that more obvious we're going introduces some graphical conventions, illustrated with the very simple call `f(x, "y", 1)`. \index{abstract syntax tree}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-simple.png", dpi = 450)
```
  
*   Function __calls__ define the hierarchy of the tree. Calls are shown
    with an orange square. The first child is the function that gets called,
    here `f`. The second and subsequent children are the arguments. 
  
    NB:Unlike many tree diagrams the order of the children is important: 
    `f(x, 1)` is not the same as `f(1, x)`.
    
*   The leaves of the tree are either __symbols__, like `f` and `x`, or 
    __constants__ like `1` or `"y"`. Symbols have a purple border and rounded 
    corners. Constants, which are atomic vectors of length one, have black 
    borders and square corners. Strings are always surrounded in quotes so
    you can more easily distinguish from symbols --- more on that important
    difference later.


Every call in R can be written in this form, even if it doesn't look like it at first glance. Take `y <- x * 10` again: what function is being called? It not as easy to spot as `f(x, 1)` because this expression uses __infix__ form. Infix functions come **in**between their arguments (so an infix function can only have two arguments). Most functions in R are __prefix__ functions where the name of the function comes first. 

(Some programming languages use __postfix__ functions where the name of the function comes last. If you ever used an old HP calculator, you might have fallen in love with reverse Polish notation, postfix notation for algebra. There is also a family of "stack"-based programming languages descending from Forth which takes this idea as far as it might possibly go.)

### Infix vs. prefix

In R, any infix call can be converted to a prefix call if you you escape the function name with backticks. That means that these two lines of code are equivalent:

```{r}
y <- x * 10
`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10))
```

And their AST looks like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-prefix.png", dpi = 450)
```

Drawing these diagrams by hand takes me some time, and obviously you can't rely on me to draw diagrams for own code. So to supplement the hand-drawn trees, we'll also use some computer-drawn trees made by `lobstr::ast()`. `ast()` tries to make trees as similar as possible to my hand-drawn trees, while respecting the limitations of the console. I don't think they're quite as easy to visually parse, but they're not too bad. If you're running in an interactive terminal, you'll see calls in orange and names in purple.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(y <- x * 10)
```

`ast()` also prints the argument names when they're used:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(mean(x = mtcars$cyl, na.rm = TRUE))
```

We can use `ast()` to peak into even more complex calls. In this call, note the special forms used by `function`, `if`, and `{}` are just regular nodes in the tree.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(function(x, y, z) {
  if (x > y) {
    z - x
  } else {
    z + y
  }
})
```

For more complex code, you can also use RStudio's tree viewer to explore them interactively. Activate with `View(quote(y <- x * 10))`.

### Constants

__constants__ include the length one atomic vectors, like `"a"` or `10`,
They have the interesting property that quoting is idempotent:

```{r}
identical(1, quote(1))
identical("test", quote("test"))
```

Note that you can't directly create longer vectors because there's no way that doesn't involve calling a function:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(c(1, 2, 3))
lobstr::ast(1:3)
```

### Symbols {#names}

Symbols, represent the name of an object rather than its value. `ast()` prefixes names with a backtick. \index{names} \index{symbols|see{names}}

```{r}
lobstr::ast(x)
lobstr::ast(mean)
lobstr::ast(`an unusual name`)
```

Names that would otherwise be invalid are automatically surrounded by backticks
\index{non-syntactic names}.

There's one special name that needs a little extra discussion: the empty name. It is used to represent missing arguments. This object behaves strangely. You can't bind it to a variable. If you do, it triggers an error about missing arguments. It's only useful if you want to programmatically create a function with missing arguments. \index{names|empty}

```{r, error = TRUE}
f <- function(x) 10

formals(f)$x
is.name(formals(f)$x)
as.character(formals(f)$x)

missing_arg <- formals(f)$x
# Doesn't work!
is.name(missing_arg)
```

To explicitly create it when needed, call `quote()` with a named argument:

```{r}
quote(expr = )
```

### Unquoting

Note that `ast()` supports "unquoting" with `!!` (pronounced bang-bang). We'll talk about this in detail later; for now notice that this is useful if you've already used `quote` to captured the expression in a variable.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(z)
lobstr::ast(!!z)
```

### Base R naming conventions

Before we go much further, we need a word of caution about the naming conventions we've used here. Unfortunately, base R does not have a consistent set of conventions that are used throughout functions and documentation. 

Note that `str()` does not follow these naming conventions when describing objects. Instead, calls as language objects:

```{r}
str(quote(a + b))
```

`expression()`

Name and symbol used interchangeably in base R. (Names are also called symbols. `as.symbol()` and `is.symbol()` are identical to `as.name()` and `is.name()`.)  We'll use symbol exclusively because name is too overloaded (i.e. the name of a variable).

Language object sometimes used to refer to name or call (but not constant or pairlist). `is.language()`

(NB: you may have heard of `expression()`. Unfortunately this function does not return an expression in the sense we use in this book. Instead, it returns something more like a list of expressions. See [parsing and deparsing](#parsing-and-deparsing) for more details.) 

### Exercises

1.  What does the call tree of an `if` statement with multiple `else` 
    conditions look like?

1.  Why can't an expression contain an atomic vector of length greater than one?
    Which two of the six types of atomic vector can't appear in an expression?
    Why?

## Understanding R's grammar

The set of rules used to generate these trees are known as a grammar. In this section we'll explore some of the details of that grammar learning more about precisely how R takes a string representing code and turning it into a tree.

### Operator precedence and associativity

The AST has to resolve two sources of ambiguity when parsing infix operators. First, what does `1 + 2 * 3` yield? Do you get 7 (i.e. `(1 + 2) * 3`), or 9 (i.e. `1 + (2 * 3)`).  Which of the two possible parse trees below does R use?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-ambig-order.png", dpi = 450)
```

Infix functions introduce an ambiguity in the parser in a way that prefix functions do not. Programming langauges resolve this using a set of conventions known as __operator precedence__. We can reveal the answer using `ast()`: 

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 * 3)
```

Second, is `1 + 2 + 3` parsed as `(1 + 2) + 3` or `1 + (2 + 3)`? 

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 + 3)
```

This is called __left-associativity__ because the the operations on the left are evaluated first. The order of arithmetic doesn't usually matter because `x + y == y + x`. However, some S3 classes define `+` in a non-associative way. For example, in ggplot2 the order of arithmetic does matter.

(These two sources of ambiguity do not exist in postfix languages which is one reason that people like them. They also don't exist in prefix languages, but you have to type a bunch of extra parentheses.)

### Whitespace

R, in general, is not very sensitive to white space. Most white space is not signficiant and is not recorded in the AST. `x+y` yields exactly the same AST as `x +        y`.

There is one place, however, where whitespace is quite important:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(y <- x)
lobstr::ast(y < -x)
```

### The function component

The first component of the call is a usually a symbol that resolves to a function:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(a, 1))
```

But it might also be a function factory, a function that when called returns another function:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f()(a, 1))
```

And of course that function might also take arguments:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(a, 1)())
```

These forms are relatively rare, but it's good to be able to recognise them when they crop up. Here they are in hand-drawn trees:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-ambig-nesting.png", dpi = 450)
```

### Exercises

1.  Which arithmetic operation is right associative?

1.  Why does `x1 <- x2 <- x3 <- 0` work? There are two reasons.

1.  Compare `x + y %+% z` to `x ^ y %+% z`. What do they
    tell you about the precedence of custom infix functions?

## Extracting, modifying, and creating calls {#calls}

A call is very similar to a list. It has `length`, `[[` and `[` methods, and is recursive because calls can contain other calls. The first element of the call is the function that gets called. \index{calls}

```{r}
x <- quote(read.table("important.csv", row = FALSE))
lobstr::ast(!!x)
```

The length of a call minus 1 gives the number of arguments:

```{r}
length(x) - 1
```

And the names includes any named arguments:

```{r}
names(x)
```

### Subsetting

You can extract the leaves of the call by position or by name:

```{r}
x[[1]]
x[[2]]

x$row
```

You can use `[` to extract multiple components, but if you drop the the first element, you're usually going to end up with a weird call:

```{r}
x[2:3]
```

There are many ways to supply the arguments to a function. To work around this problem, you can use `rlang::lang_standardise()` which uses the base `match.call()` function to convert all positional arguments to named arguments: \indexc{standardise\_call()} \indexc{match.call()}

```{r}
rlang::lang_standardise(x)
```

### Constructing

```{r}
lang(quote(`+`), 1, 2)
lang("+", 1, 2)

args <- list(1 , 2)
lang("f", args, 3)
lang("f", quote(list(1, 2)), 3)
lang("f", splice(args), 3)
```

### Quasiquotation

With these basics in place it's time to come back to quasiquotation.

We call functions like `ast()` and `quote()` that capture their arguments without evaluating them quoting functions. 

Functions that quote their arguments in rlang all also support unquoting.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

### Inlining and the deparser

If you construct ASTs by hand, it's possible to construct things that you could not construct by parsing code. You can inline more complex objects. This is useful in a handful of very advanced places. But important to be aware that the printed representation

```{r}
lang(`+`, 1, 2)
```

```{r}
x1 <- lang("+", 1, lang("+", 2, 3))
x1
lobstr::ast(!!x1)

x2 <- quote(1 + (2 + 3))
x2
lobstr::ast(!!x2)
```

Integer sequences are printed with `:`

```{r}
x1 <- lang("f", 1:10)
x1
lobstr::ast(!!x1)

x2 <- lang("f", quote(1:10))
x2
lobstr::ast(!!x2)
```

```{r}
x1 <- quote(!!x)
x1
lobstr::ast(!!x1)
```

The following constructs an AST containing an inline data frame. This is a bad idea, however, because the object does not print correctly: the printed call looks like it should return "list" but when evaluated, it returns "data.frame". \indexc{substitute()}

```{r}
class_df <- lang("class", data.frame(x = 10))
class_df
lobstr::ast(!!class_df)

eval(class_df)
```

### Exercises

1.  You can use `formals()` to both get and set the arguments of a function.
    Use `formals()` to modify the following function so that the default value
    of `x` is missing and `y` is 10.

    ```{r}
    g <- function(x = 20, y) {
      x + y
    }
    ```

1.  Write an equivalent to `get()` using `as.name()` and `eval()`. Write an
    equivalent to `assign()` using `as.name()`, `substitute()`, and `eval()`.
    (Don't worry about the multiple ways of choosing an environment; assume
    that the user supplies it explicitly.)

### Exercises

1.  The following two calls look the same, but are actually different:

    ```{r}
    (a <- call("mean", 1:10))
    (b <- call("mean", quote(1:10)))
    identical(a, b)
    ```

    What's the difference? Which one should you prefer?

1.  Implement a pure R version of `do.call()`.

1.  Concatenating a call and an expression with `c()` creates a list. Implement
    `concat()` so that the following code works to combine a call and
    an additional argument.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    concat(quote(f), a = 1, b = quote(mean(a)))
    #> f(a = 1, b = mean(a))
    ```

1.  Since `list()`s don't belong in expressions, we could create a more
    convenient call constructor that automatically combines lists into the
    arguments. Implement `make_call()` so that the following code works.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    make_call(quote(mean), list(quote(x), na.rm = TRUE))
    #> mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    make_call(quote(mean), quote(x), na.rm = TRUE)
    #> mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    ```

1.  How does `mode<-` work? How does it use `call()`?

1.  Read the source for `pryr::standardise_call()`. How does it work?
    Why is `is.primitive()` needed?

1.  `standardise_call()` doesn't work so well for the following calls.
    Why?

    ```{r}
    standardise_call(quote(mean(1:10, na.rm = TRUE)))
    standardise_call(quote(mean(n = T, 1:10)))
    standardise_call(quote(mean(x = 1:10, , TRUE)))
    ```

1.  Read the documentation for `pryr::modify_call()`. How do you think
    it works? Read the source code.

1.  Use `ast()` and experimentation to figure out the three arguments in an
    `if()` call. Which components are required? What are the arguments to
    the `for()` and `while()` calls?


## Parsing and deparsing {#parsing-and-deparsing}

Sometimes code is represented as a string, rather than as an expression. You can convert a string to an expression with `parse()`. `parse()` is the opposite of `deparse()`: it takes a character vector and returns an expression object. The primary use of `parse()` is parsing files of code to disk, so the first argument is a file path. Note that if you have code in a character vector, you need to use the `text` argument: \indexc{parse()}

```{r}
z <- quote(y <- x * 10)
deparse(z)

parse(text = deparse(z))
```

Because there might be many top-level calls in a file, `parse()` doesn't return just a single expression. Instead, it returns an expression object, which is essentially a list of expressions: \index{expression object} 

```{r}
exp <- parse(text = c("
  x <- 4
  x
  5
"))
length(exp)
typeof(exp)

exp[[1]]
exp[[2]]
```

You can create expression objects by hand with `expression()`, but I wouldn't recommend it. There's no need to learn about this esoteric data structure if you already know how to use expressions. \indexc{expression()}

With `parse()` and `eval()`, it's possible to write a simple version of `source()`. We read in the file from disk, `parse()` it and then `eval()` each component in a specified environment. This version defaults to a new environment, so it doesn't affect existing objects. `source()` invisibly returns the result of the last expression in the file, so `simple_source()` does the same. \index{source()}

```{r}
simple_source <- function(file, envir = new.env()) {
  stopifnot(file.exists(file))
  stopifnot(is.environment(envir))

  lines <- readLines(file, warn = FALSE)
  exprs <- parse(text = lines)

  n <- length(exprs)
  if (n == 0L) return(invisible())

  for (i in seq_len(n - 1)) {
    eval(exprs[i], envir)
  }
  invisible(eval(exprs[n], envir))
}
```

The real `source()` is considerably more complicated because it can `echo` input and output, and also has many additional settings to control behaviour.

### Exercises

1.  What are the differences between `quote()` and `expression()`?

1.  Read the help for `deparse()` and construct a call that `deparse()`
    and `parse()` do not operate symmetrically on.

1.  Compare and contrast `source()` and `sys.source()`.

1.  Modify `simple_source()` so it returns the result of _every_ expression,
    not just the last one.

1.  The code generated by `simple_source()` lacks source references. Read
    the source code for `sys.source()` and the help for `srcfilecopy()`,
    then modify `simple_source()` to preserve source references. You can
    test your code by sourcing a function that contains a comment. If
    successful, when you look at the function, you'll see the comment and
    not just the source code.
