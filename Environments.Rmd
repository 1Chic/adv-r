## Introduction

The environment is the data structure that powers scoping. This chapter dives deep into environments, describing their structure in depth, and using them to improve your understanding of the four scoping rules described in [lexical scoping](#lexical-scoping). \index{environments}

Understanding environments is not necessary for day-to-day use of R. But they are important to understand because they power many important R features like lexical scoping, namespaces, and R6 classes, and interact with evaluation to give you powerful tools for making domain specific languages like dplyr and ggplot2.

### Quiz {-}

If you can answer the following questions correctly, you already know the most important topics in this chapter. You can find the answers at the end of the chapter in [answers](#env-answers).

1.  List at least three ways that an environment is different to a list.

1.  What is the parent of the global environment? What is the only 
    environment that doesn't have a parent?
    
1.  What is the enclosing environment of a function? Why is it 
    important?

1.  How do you determine the environment from which a function was called?

1.  How are `<-` and `<<-` different?

### Outline {-}

* [Environment basics](#env-basics) introduces you to the basic properties
  of an environment and shows you how to create your own.
  
* [Recursing over environments](#env-recursion) provides a function template
  for computing with environments, illustrating the idea with a useful
  function.
  
* [Explicit environments](#explicit-envs) discusses three problems where
  environments are useful data structures in their own right, independent
  of the role they play in scoping.

### Prerequisites {-}

This chapter will use rlang functions for working with environments, because it allows you to focus on the essence of environments, rather than the incidental details. I'll use sidebars to show the base R equivalents where needed.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(rlang)

# Some API changes that haven't made it in rlang yet
search_envs <- function() {
  c(
    list(global_env()),
    head(env_parents(global_env()), -1)
  )
}
```

## Environment basics {#env-basics}

Generally, an environment is similar to a named list, with four important exceptions:

*   Every name must be unique.

*   The names in an environment are not ordered (i.e., it doesn't make sense 
    to ask what the first element of an environment is).

*   An environment has a parent. 

*   Environments have reference semantics. 

Let's explore these ideas with pictures. 

### Creating 
\index{environments!creating}

To create an environment, use `rlang::env()`. Like `list()` it takes a set of name-value pairs.

```{r}
e <- env(a = 1, b = 2)
e
```

::: base
Use `new.env()` to creates a new environment. Ignore the `hash` and `size` parameters; they are not needed. Note that you can not simultaneously create and define values; use `$<-`, as shown below.
:::

### Bindings
\index{bindings} \index{assignment|see{bindings}}

The job of an environment is to associate, or __bind__, a set of names to a set of values. You can think of an environment as a bag of names, with no implied order (i.e. it doesn't make sense to ask which is the first element in an environment). Take this environment, which contains bindings between four names and four objects:

```{r}
e1 <- env(
  a = FALSE,
  b = "a",
  c = 2.3,
  d = 1:3,
)
```

The objects exist independently of the environment; the enviroment just gives them names. That allows us to draw them as so:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/bindings.png", dpi = 300)
```

(I'll explain the blue dot shortly.)

It's possible for multiple names to point to the same object:

```{r}
e1$a <- e1$d
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/multiple-names.png", dpi = 300)
```

And those names can live in different environments:

```{r}
f <- env()
f$x <- e1$a
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/multiple-names-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

(But remember as soon as you modify one of those objects they will no longer point to the same place. See [names and values](#names-values) for more details.)

Environments have reference semantics: unlike most R objects, when you modify them, you them modify in place, and don't create a copy. We'll explore the fuller implications in [Explicit environments], but here I wanted to show one important implication: environments can contain themselves. This means that environments go one step further in their level of recursion than lists: an enviroment can contain any object, including itself!

```{r}
e1$d <- e1
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/loop.png", dpi = 300)
```

To see what bindings an environment currently possesses, use `env_names()`:

```{r}
env_names(e1)
```

[Use `env_show()`]{.todo}

::: base
`names()` is to equivalent to `env_names()` (from R 3.2 on). You can also use  `ls()` (which was recommended in the first edition of the book, and works in all versions of R), but note that the default value of `all.names` is `FALSE` so you don't see any bindings that start with `.`.
:::

### Parents

Every environment has a __parent__, another environment. Diagrams draw the parent as a small pale blue circle and arrow that points to another environment. The parent is what's used to implement lexical scoping: if a name is not found in an environment, then R will look in its parent (and so on). 

You can set the parent environment by supplying the first argument to `env()`. If you don't supply it, it defaults to the current environment.

```{r}
e2a <- env(d = 4, e = 5)
e2b <- env(e2a, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/parents.png", dpi = 300)
```

\index{environments!empty}
Only one environment doesn't have a parent: the __empty__ environment. I draw the empty environment with a hollow parent environment, and when space allows I'll label with `R_EmptyEnv`, the name R uses.

```{r}
e2c <- env(empty_env(), d = 4, e = 5)
e2d <- env(e2c, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/parents-empty.png", dpi = 300)
```

We use the metaphor of a family to name environments relative to one another. The grandparent of an environment is the parent's parent, and the ancestors include all parent environments up to the empty environment. To save space, I typically won't draw all the ancestors; just remember when ever you see a pale blue circle, there's an parent environment somewhere. It's rare to talk about the children of an environment because there are no back links: given an environment we have no way to find its children.

You can find the parent of an environment with `env_parent()`:

```{r}
env_parent(e2d)
env_parent(e2c)
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
env_parent(empty_env())
```

And list all ancestors with `env_parents()`:

```{r}
env_parents(e2d)
```

::: base 
Use `parent.env()` to find the parent of an environment. No base function returns all ancestors.
:::

### `<<-`

The regular assignment arrow, `<-`, always creates a variable in the current environment. The deep assignment arrow, `<<-`, never creates a variable in the current environment, but instead modifies an existing variable found by walking up the parent environments. 

```{r}
x <- 0
f <- function() {
  x <<- 1
}
f()
x
```

If `<<-` doesn't find an existing variable, it will create one in the global environment. This is usually undesirable, because global variables introduce non-obvious dependencies between functions. `<<-` is most often used in conjunction with a closure, as described in [Closures](#closures).


### Comparing

To compare environments, use `identical()` not `==`:

```{r, error = TRUE}
identical(global_env(), environment())
global_env() == environment()
```

### Modifying

You can get and set elements of a environment with `$` and `[[` in the same way as a list:

```{r}
e3 <- env(x = 1, y = 2)
e3$x
e3$z <- 3
e3[["z"]]
```

But you can't use `[[` with numeric indices, and you can't use `[`:

```{r, error = TRUE}
e3[[1]]

e3[c("x", "y")]
```

`$` and `[[` will return `NULL` if the binding doesn not exist. Use `env_get()` if you want an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
e3$xyz

env_get(e3, "xyz")
```

There are two other ways to add bindings to an environment: `env_poke()`[^poke] takes a name (as string) and a value and `env_bind()` allows you to bind multiple values. 

```{r}
env_poke(e3, "a", 100)
e3$a

env_bind(e3, a = 10, b = 20)
env_names(e3)
```

[^poke]: You might wonder why rlang has `env_poke()` instead of `env_set()`. This is for consistency: `_set()` functions return a modified copy; `_poke()` functions modify in place.

You can determine if an environment has a binding with `env_has()`:

```{r}
env_has(e3, "a")
```

Unlike lists, setting an element to `NULL` does not remove it. Instead, use `env_unbind()`:

```{r}
e3$a <- NULL
env_has(e3, "a")

env_unbind(e3, "a")
env_has(e3, "a")
```

Unbinding a name doesn't delete the object. That's the job of the garbage collector, which automatically removes objects with no names binding to them. This process is described in more detail in [GC](#gc).

::: base
\indexc{rm()}\indexc{assign()}\indexc{get()}\indexc{exists()}
See `get()`, `assign()`, `exists()`, and `rm()`. These are designed interactively the current environment, so the interface for working with environment objects is a little clunky. Also beware the `inherits` argument: it defaults to `TRUE` meaning that the base equivalents will inspect the supplied environment and all its ancestors.
:::

### Advanced bindings
\index{bindings!delayed} \index{bindings!active}

There are two more exotic variants of `env_bind()`:

*   `env_bind_exprs()` creates __delayed bindings__, which are evaluated the
    first time they are accessed. Behind the scenes, delayed bindings create 
    promises, so behave in the same way as function arguments.

    ```{r, cache = TRUE}
    env_bind_exprs(current_env(), b = {Sys.sleep(1); 1})
    
    system.time(print(b))
    system.time(print(b))
    ```

    Delayed bindings are used to implement `autoload()`, which makes R behave 
    as if the package data is in memory, even though it's only loaded from 
    disk when you ask for it.
  
*   `env_bind_fns()` creates __active bindings__ which are re-computed every 
    time they're accessed:

    ```{r}
    env_bind_fns(current_env(), z1 = function(val) runif(1))
    
    z1
    z1
    ```

    The argument to the function allows you to also override behaviour when
    the variable is set:
    
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    env_bind_fns(current_env(), z2 = function(val) {
      if (missing(val)) {
        2
      } else {
         stop("Don't touch z2!", call. = FALSE)
      }
    })
    
    z2
    z2 <- 3
    ```

### Exercises

1.  List three ways in which an environment differs from a list.

1.  Create an environment as illustrated by this picture.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/recursive-1.png", dpi = 300)
    ```

1.  Create a pair of environments as illustrated by this picture.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/recursive-2.png", dpi = 300)
    ```

1.  Explain why `e[[1]]` and `e[c("a", "b")]` don't make sense when `e` is
    an environment.

1.  Create a version of `env_poke()` that will only bind new names, never 
    re-bind old names. Some programming languages only do this, and are known 
    as [single assignment languages][single assignment].

1.  Write an binding function that can do active, delayed, and locked 
    bindings. What might you call it? What arguments should it take? Can you 
    guess which sort of assignment it should do based on the input?

## Recursing over environments {#env-recursion}
\index{recursion!over environments}

If you want to operate on every ancestor of an environment, it's often convenient to write a recursive function. This section shows you how by applying your new knowledge of environments to write a function that given a name, finds the environment `where()` that name is defined, using R's regular scoping rules. 

The definition of `where()` is straightforward. It has two arguments: the name to look for (as a string), and the environment in which to start the search. (We'll learn why `caller_env()` is a good default in [calling environments](#calling-environments).)

```{r}
where <- function(name, env = caller_env()) {
  if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
    # Base case
    stop("Can't find ", name, call. = FALSE)
  } else if (env_has(env, name)) {
    # Success case
    env
  } else {
    # Recursive case
    where(name, env_parent(env))
  }
}
```

There are three cases:

* The base case: we've reached the empty environment and haven't found the
  binding. We can't go any further, so we throw an error. 

* The successful case: the name exists in this environment, so we return the
  environment.

* The recursive case: the name was not found in this environment, so try the 
  parent.

These three cases are illustrated with these three examples:

```{r, error = TRUE}
where("yyy")

x <- 5
where("x")

where("mean")
```

It might help to see a picture. Imagine you have two environments, as in the following code and diagram:

```{r}
e4a <- env(empty_env(), a = 1, b = 2)
e4b <- env(e4a, x = 10, a = 11)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/where-ex.png", dpi = 300)
```

* `where(a, e4a)` will find `a` in `e4a`.

* `where("b", e4a)` doesn't find `b` in `e4a`, so it looks in its parent, `e4b`,
  and finds it there.

* `where("c", e4a)` looks in `e4a`, then `e4b`, then hits the empty environment
  and throws an error.

It's natural to work with environments recursively, so `where()` provides a useful template. Removing the specifics of `where()` shows the structure more clearly:

```{r}
f <- function(..., env = caller_env()) {
  if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
    # base case
  } else if (success) {
    # success case
  } else {
    # recursive case
    f(..., env = env_parent(env))
  }
}
```

::: sidebar

### Iteration vs recursion {-}

It's possible to use a loop instead of recursion. This might run slightly faster (because we eliminate some function calls), but I think it's harder to understand. I include it because you might find it easier to see what's happening if you're less familiar with recursive functions.

```{r}
f2 <- function(..., env = caller_env()) {
  while (!identical(env, empty_env())) {
    if (success) {
      # success case
      return()
    }
    # inspect parent
    env <- env_parent(env)
  }

  # base case
}
```

:::

### Exercises

1.  Modify `where()` to return _all_ environments that contain a binding for
    `name`.

1.  Write your own version of `env_get()` using a function written in the style 
    of `where()`.

1.  What does this function do? How does it differ from `<<-` and why
    might you prefer it?
    
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    rebind <- function(name, value, env = caller_env()) {
      if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
        stop("Can't find `", name, "`", call. = FALSE)
      } else if (env_has(env, name)) {
        env_poke(env, name, value)
      } else {
        rebind(name, value, env_parent(env))
      }
    }
    rebind("a", 10)
    a <- 5
    rebind("a", 10)
    a
    ```

1.  Write a function called `fget()` that finds only function objects. It 
    should have two arguments, `name` and `env`, and should obey the regular 
    scoping rules for functions: if there's an object with a matching name 
    that's not a function, look in the parent. For an added challenge, also 
    add an `inherits` argument which controls whether the function recurses up 
    the parents or only looks in one environment.

## Special environments {#function-envs}
\index{functions!environments}
 
Most environments are not created by you (e.g. with `env()`) but are instead created by R. In this section, you'll learn about the most important environments, starting with the global and package environments. You'll then learn then about the function environment bound to the function when it is created, and the (usually) ephemeral execution environment created every time the function is called. Finally, you'll see how the package and function environments interact to support namespaces, which ensure that a package always behaves the same way, regardless of what other packages the user has loaded.

### The global environment

The global environment, `global_env()`, is the interactive workspace. This is the current environment in which you normally work:

```{r}
current_env()
```

And working with the global environment object is equivalent to getting and setting values at the console:

```{r}
a <- 1
env_get(global_env(), "a")

env_poke(global_env(), "b", 10)
b
```

### Package environments and the search path
\indexc{search()} \index{search path}

The parent of the global environment is the last package you attached[^attach]:

[^attach]: Attached is different to load. A package is loaded automatically if you access one of its functions using `::`; it is only __attached__ to the search path by `library()` or `require()`.

```{r}
env_parent(global_env())
```

And the parent of that package is the second to last package you attached:

```{r}
env_parent(env_parent(global_env()))
```

If you follow all the parents back, you see every package that has been attached in the current session:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
search_envs()
#> [[1]]  <environment: R_GlobalEnv>
#> [[2]]  <environment: package:rlang>
#> [[3]]  <environment: package:methods>
#> [[4]]  <environment: package:stats>
#> [[5]]  <environment: package:graphics>
#> [[6]]  <environment: package:grDevices>
#> [[7]]  <environment: package:utils>
#> [[8]]  <environment: package:datasets>
#> [[9]]  <environment: Autoloads>
#> [[10]] <environment: base>
```

This is the so-called __search path__ because all objects in these environments can be found from the top-level interactive workspace. You can access the names of these environments with `base::search()`:

```{r}
search()
```

The last two environments are always the same:

* The `Autoloads` environment uses delayed bindings to save memory by only 
  loading package objects (like big datasets) when needed. 
  
* The base environment, `package:base` or sometimes just `base`, is the
  environment of the base package. It is special because it has to be able 
  to bootstrap the loading of all other packages. The parent of the base 
  environment is the empty environment. You can also access it directly with
  `base_env()`.

Graphically, the search path looks like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/search-path.png", dpi = 300)
```

When you attach another package with `library()`, the parent environment of the global environment changes:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/search-path-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

### The function environment
\index{environments!function}

A function binds the current environment when it is created. This is called the __function environment__, and is used for lexical scoping. Across computer languages, functions that capture their environments are called __closures__, which why this term is often used interchangeably with function in R's documentation.

You can get the function environment with `fn_env()`: 

```{r}
y <- 1
f <- function(x) x + y
fn_env(f)
```

::: base 
Use `environment(f)` to access the environment of function `f`.
:::

In diagrams, I'll depict functions as rectangles with a rounded end that binds an environment. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/binding.png", dpi = 300)
```

In this case, `f()` binds the environment that binds the name `f` to the function. But that's not always the case: in the following example `g` is bound in a new environment `e`, but `g()` binds the global environment. The distinction being binding and being bound by is subtle but important; the difference is how we find `g` vs. how `g` finds its variables.

```{r}
e <- env()
e$g <- function() 1
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/binding-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Namespaces
\index{namespaces}

In the diagram above, you saw that the parent environment of a package varies based on what other packages have been loaded. This seems worrying: doesn't that mean that the package will find different functions if packages are loaded in a different order? The goal of __namespaces__ is to make sure that this does not happen, and that every package works the same way regardless of what packages are attached by the user. 

[Find concrete example]{.todo}

Every function in a package is associated with a pair of environments: the package environment, which you learned about earlier, and the __namespace__ environment. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/namespace-bind.png", dpi = 300)
```

The package environment is the external interface to the package. It's how you find a function in an attached package or with `::`. Its parent is determined by the order in which the user has loaded packages. 

The namespace environment is the internal interface to the package. The package environment controls look up of the function; the namespace controls lookup __by__ the function. Every namespace environment has the same set of ancestors:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/namespace-env.png", dpi = 300)
```

* Each namespace has an __imports__ environment that contains bindings to all 
  the functions used by the package. The imports environment is controlled by 
  the package developer with the `NAMESPACE` file.

* Explicitly importing every base funtion would be tiresome, so the parent
  of the imports environment is the base __namespace__. The base namespace 
  contains the same bindings as the base environment, but it has different
  parent.
  
* The parent of the base namespace is the global environment. This means that 
  if a binding isn't defined in the imports environment the packge will look
  for it in the usual way. This is usually a bad idea (because it makes code
  depend on other loaded packages), so `R CMD check` automatically warns about
  such code. It is needed, however, in order for S3 methods to work.

Putting all these diagrams together we get:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/namespace.png", dpi = 300)
```

Note that every binding in the package environment is also found in the namespace environment; this ensures every function can use every other function. But some binding only occur in the namespace environment; these are known as internal or non-exported objects. This makes it possible to hide internal implementation details from the user.

Note that there's no direct link between the package and namespace environments; the link is define by the function environments.

### Execution environments

The last important topic we need to cover is the __execution__ environment. What will the following function return the first time it's run? What about the second? \index{environments!execution}

```{r}
g <- function(x) {
  if (!env_has(current_env(), "a")) {
    message("Defining a")
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a
}
```

Think about it for a moment before you read on.

```{r}
g(10)
g(10)
```

This function returns the same value every time because of the fresh start principle, described in [a fresh start](#fresh-start). Each time a function is called, a new environment is created to host execution. This is called the execution environment, and its parent is the function environment. Let's illustrate that process with a simpler function. I'll draw execution environments with an indirect parent; the parent environment is found via the function environment.

```{r}
h <- function(x) {
  # 1.
  a <- 2 # 2.
  x + a
}
y <- h(1) # 3.
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/execution.png", dpi = 300)
```

The execution environment is usually ephemeral; once the function has completed, the environment will be GC'd. There are several ways to make it stay around for longer. The first is to explicitly return it:

[use `env_print()` when available]{.todo}

```{r}
h2 <- function(x) {
  a <- 2
  current_env()
}
e <- h2(x = 10)
env_names(e)

env_parent(e)
fn_env(h2)
```
\index{closures|environment}

Another way to capture it is to return an object with a binding to that environment, like a function. The following example illustrates that idea with a function factory, `plus()`. We use that factory to create a function called `plus_one()`. 

There's a lot going on in the diagram because the enclosing environment of `plus_one()` is the execution environment of `plus()`. 

```{r}
plus <- function(x) {
  function(y) x + y
}

plus_one <- plus(1)
plus_one
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/closure.png", dpi = 300)
```

What happens when we call `plus_one()`? Its execution environment will have the captured execution environment of `plus()` as its parent:

```{r}
plus_one(2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/closure-call.png", dpi = 300)
```

You'll learn more about function factories in [functional programming](#functional-programming).

### Exercises

1.  Draw a diagram that shows the enclosing environments of this function:
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f1 <- function(x1) {
      f2 <- function(x2) {
        f3 <- function(x3) {
          x1 + x2 + x3
        }
        f3(3)
      }
      f2(2)
    }
    f1(1)
    ```

1.  Write an enhanced version of `str()` that provides more information 
    about functions. Show where the function was found and what environment 
    it was defined in.

## Frames and the call stack
\index{environments|calling}

There is one last environment we need to explain, the __caller__ environment. To explain this environment we need to introduce two new concepts: the call stack and frames. Executing a function creates two types of context. You've learn about one already: the execution environment is a child of the function environment, which is determined by where the function was created. There's another type of context created by where the function was called: this is called the __call stack__.

Let's illustrate this with a simple sequence of calls: `f()` calls `g()` calls `h()`.

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  g(x = 2)
}
g <- function(x) {
  h(x = 3)
}
h <- function(x) {
  stop()
}
```

The way you most commonly see a call stack in R is after by looking at the `traceback()` after an error has occured:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
f(x = 1)
#> Error:
traceback()
#> 4: stop()
#> 3: h(x = 3) 
#> 2: g(x = 2)
#> 1: f(x = 1)
```

We can represent the call stack just before the error occurs with this diagram:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/calling.png", dpi = 300)
```

(To focus on the calling environments, I have omitted the bindings in the global environment from `f`, `g`, and `h` to the respective function objects.)

Each element of the call stack is a __frame__[^frame], also known as an evaluation context. A frame has three main components:

* An expression (labelled with `expr`) giving the function call. This is
  what `traceback()` prints out.

* An environment (labelled with `env`), which is typically the execution 
  environment of a funtion. There are two main exceptions: the environment of 
  the global frame is the global environment, and calling `eval()` also 
  generates frames, where the environment can be anything.

* A parent, the previous call in the call stack (shown by a grey arrow). 

The frame is an extremely important internal data structure. It also holds exit handlers created with `on.exit()`, restarts and handlers for the the condition system, and which context to `return()` to when a function completes.  R code can only access a small part of the data structure because it's so important: making changes without using the official API could be disastrous.

[^frame]: NB: `?environment` uses frame in a different sense: "Environments consist of a _frame_, or collection of named objects, and a pointer to an enclosing environment.". We avoid this sense of frame, which comes from S, because it's very specific and not widely used in base R. For example, the "frame" in `parent.frame()` is an execution context, not a collection of named objects.


::: base
Rather than one function that exposes a list of frame objects, base R provides functions that return lists of the individual components. Use `sys.frames()` to access environments and `sys.calls()` to access expressions.
:::


While you can access any frame environment in the call stack, there is one only environment that you routinely _should_: __caller__ environment, which you can access with `caller_env()`. This is a good default for an user directed function that needs an environment argument.

::: base
`parent.frame()` is equivalent to `caller_env()`; confusingly it returns an environment, not a frame. However, most functions that modify an attribute of the frame will use the current environment to find the current frame.
::: 

\index{scoping!dynamic} \index{dynamic scoping}

Looking up variables in the calling stack rather than in the enclosing environment is called __dynamic scoping__. Few languages implement dynamic scoping (Emacs Lisp is a [notable exception](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html#SEC15).) This is because dynamic scoping makes it much harder to reason about how a function operates: not only do you need to know how it was defined, you also need to know in what context it was called. Dynamic scoping is primarily useful for developing functions that aid interactive data analysis. It is one of the topics discussed in [non-standard evaluation](#nse). 

## As data structures {#explicit-envs}

As well as powering scoping, environments are also useful data structures in their own right because they have reference semantics.  There are three common problems that they can help solve:

*   __Avoiding copies of large data__. Since environments have reference semantics, 
    you'll never accidentally create a copy. This makes it a useful vessel for 
    large objects. Bare environments are not that pleasant to work with;
    I recommend using R6 objects instead. Learn more in [R6].
  
*   __Managing state within a package__. Explicit environments are useful in 
    packages because they allow you to maintain state across function calls. 
    Normally, objects in a package are locked, so you can't modify them 
    directly. Instead, you can do something like this:

    ```{r}
    my_env <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())
    my_env$a <- 1
    
    get_a <- function() {
      my_env$a
    }
    set_a <- function(value) {
      old <- my_env$a
      my_env$a <- value
      invisible(old)
    }
    ```

    Returning the old value from setter functions is a good pattern because 
    it makes it easier to reset the previous value in conjunction with 
    `on.exit()` (see more in [on exit](#on-exit)).

*   __As a hashmap__. A hashmap is a data structure that takes constant, O(1), 
    time to find an object based on its name. Environments provide this 
    behaviour by default, so can be used to simulate a hashmap. See the 
    CRAN package hash for a complete development of this idea.

## Quiz answers {#env-answers}

1.  There are four ways: every object in an environment must have a name;
    order doesn't matter; environments have parents; environments have
    reference semantics.
   
1.  The parent of the global environment is the last package that you
    loaded. The only environment that doesn't have a parent is the empty
    environment.
    
1.  The enclosing environment of a function is the environment where it
    was created. It determines where a function looks for variables.
    
1.  Use `caller_env()` or `parent.frame()`.

1.  `<-` always creates a binding in the current environment; `<<-`
    rebinds an existing name in a parent of the current environment.
