## Introduction

The environment is the data structure that powers scoping. This chapter dives deep into environments, describing their structure in depth, and using them to improve your understanding of the four scoping rules described in [lexical scoping](#lexical-scoping). \index{environments}

Environments can also be useful data structures in their own right because they have reference semantics. When you modify a binding in an environment, the environment is not copied; it's modified in place. Reference semantics are not often needed, but can be extremely useful.

### Quiz {-}

If you can answer the following questions correctly, you already know the most important topics in this chapter. You can find the answers at the end of the chapter in [answers](#env-answers).

1.  List at least three ways that an environment is different to a list.

1.  What is the parent of the global environment? What is the only 
    environment that doesn't have a parent?
    
1.  What is the enclosing environment of a function? Why is it 
    important?

1.  How do you determine the environment from which a function was called?

1.  How are `<-` and `<<-` different?

### Outline {-}

* [Environment basics](#env-basics) introduces you to the basic properties
  of an environment and shows you how to create your own.
  
* [Recursing over environments](#env-recursion) provides a function template
  for computing with environments, illustrating the idea with a useful
  function.
  
* [Explicit environments](#explicit-envs) discusses three problems where
  environments are useful data structures in their own right, independent
  of the role they play in scoping.

### Prerequisites {-}

This chapter will primarily use rlang functions for working with environments, because it allows you to focus on the essence of environments, rather than the incidental details. I'll use sidebars to show the base R equivalents where needed.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(rlang)

# Some API changes that haven't made it in rlang yet
env <- function(.parent = caller_env(), ...) {
  rlang::child_env(.parent, ...)
}
current_env <- environment
```

## Environment basics {#env-basics}

Generally, an environment is similar to a list, with four important exceptions:

*   Every name in an environment is unique.

*   The names in an environment are not ordered (i.e., it doesn't make sense 
    to ask what the first element of an environment is).

*   An environment has a parent. 

*   Environments have reference semantics. 

Let's explore these ideas with pictures. 

### Creating 
\index{environments!creating}

To create an environment, use `rlang::env()`. 

```{r}
e <- env(a = 1, b = 2)
e
```

::: base

* `new.env()` creates a new environment. Ignore the `hash` and `size` 
  parameters; they are not needed. Note that you can not simultaneously 
  create and define values; use `$<-` as shown below.

:::

### Bindings
\index{bindings} \index{assignment|see{bindings}}

The job of an environment is to associate, or __bind__, a set of names to a set of values. You can think of an environment as a bag of names: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/bag-of-names.png", dpi = 300)
```

There is no implied order to these names (i.e. it doesn't make sense to ask which is the first element in an environment), but each name must be unique.

Take this environment, which contains bindings between four names and four objects:

```{r}
e1 <- env(
  a = FALSE,
  b = "a",
  c = 2.3,
  d = 1:3,
)
```

The objects exist independently of the environment; the enviroment just gives them names. That allows us to draw them as so:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/bindings.png", dpi = 300)
```

It's possible for multiple names to point to the same object:

```{r}
e1$a <- e1$d
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/multiple-names.png", dpi = 300)
```

And those names can live in different environments:

```{r}
f <- env()
f$x <- e1$a
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/multiple-names-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

(But remember as soon as you modify one of those objects they will no longer point to the same place.)

Confusingly, names can also point to different objects that have the same value:

```{r}
e1$a <- 1:3
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/copies.png", dpi = 300)
```

Environments have reference semantics: unlike most R objects, when you modify them, you modify in place, and don't create a copy. We'll explore the fuller implications in [Explicit environments], but here I wanted to show one important implication: environments can contain themselves. This means that environments go one step further in their level of recursion than lists. An enviroment can any object, including itself!

```{r}
e1$d <- e1
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/loop.png", dpi = 300)
```

You can list all bindings with `env_names()`:

```{r}
env_names(e1)
```

::: base
`names()` is to equivalent to `env_names()` (from R 3.2 on). You can also use  `ls()` (which was recommended in the first edition of the book, and works in all versions of R), but note that the default value of `all.names` is `FALSE` so you don't see any bindings that start with `.`.
:::

### Parents

Every environment has a __parent__, another environment. In diagrams, I'll represent the parent with a small black circle and arrow. The parent is used to implement lexical scoping: if a name is not found in an environment, then R will look in its parent (and so on). You can set the parent environment by supplying the first argument to `env()`. If you don't supply it, it defaults to the current environment.

```{r}
e2a <- env(d = 4, e = 5)
e2b <- env(e2a, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/parents.png", dpi = 300)
```

We use the metaphor of a family to name environments relative to one another. The grandparent of an environment is the parent's parent, and the ancestors include all parent environments up to the empty environment. I typically won't draw all the ancestors to save space; just remember when ever you see a sky-blue circle, there's an parent environment somewhere.

Note that It's rare to talk about the children of an environment because there are no back links: given an environment we have no way to find its children.

\index{environments!empty}
Only one environment doesn't have a parent: the __empty__ environment.

```{r}
empty_env()
env_parent(empty_env())
```

I draw the empty environment with a hollow parent environment, and when space allows I'll label with `R_EmptyEnv`, the name R uses.

```{r}
e2c <- env(emptyenv(), d = 4, e = 5)
e2d <- env(e2c, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/parents-empty.png", dpi = 300)
```

You can find the parent of an environment with `env_parent()`:

```{r}
env_parent(e2d)
env_parent(e2c)
```

Or list them all with with `env_parents()`:

```{r}
env_parents(e2d)
```

::: base 
Use `parent.env()` to find the parent of an environment.
:::

### Comparing

To compare environments, use `identical()` not `==`:

```{r, error = TRUE}
identical(global_env(), environment())
global_env() == environment()
```

### Modifying

You can get and set elements of a environment with `$` and `[[` in the same way as a list:

```{r}
e3 <- env(x = 1, y = 2)
e3$x
e3$z <- 3
e3[["z"]]
```

But you can not use `[[` with numeric indices, or `[`:

```{r, error = TRUE}
e3[[1]]

e3[c("x", "y")]
```

`$` and `[[` will return `NULL` if the binding doesn not exist. Use `env_get()` if you want an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
e3$xyz

env_get(e3, "xyz")
```

There are two other ways to add bindings to an environment: `env_poke()` takes a name and a value and `env_bind()` allows you to bind multiple values. 

```{r}
env_poke(e3, "a", 100)
e3$a

env_bind(e3, a = 10, b = 20)
env_names(e3)
```

You might wonder why rlang has `env_poke()` instead of `env_set()`. This is for consistency: `_set()` functions return a modified copy; `_poke()` functions modify in place.

You can determine an environment has a binding with `env_has()`:

```{r}
env_has(e3, "a")
```

Unlike lists, setting an element to `NULL` does not remove it. Instead use `env_unbind()`:

```{r}
e3$a <- NULL
env_has(e3, "a")

env_unbind(e3, "a")
env_has(e3, "a")
```

Unbinding a name doesn't delete the object. That's the job of the garbage collector that automatically removes objects with no names binding them. This process is described in more detail in [GC](#gc).

::: base
\indexc{rm()}\indexc{assign()}\indexc{get()}\indexc{exists()}

See `get()`, `assign()`, `rm()`, and `exists()`. Beware the `inherits` argument: it defaults to `TRUE` meaning that the base equivalents will inspect the supplied environment and all its ancestors.

:::

### Advanced bindings

The regular assignment arrow, `<-`, always creates a variable in the current environment. The deep assignment arrow, `<<-`, never creates a variable in the current environment, but instead modifies an existing variable found by walking up the parent environments. 

```{r}
x <- 0
f <- function() {
  x <<- 1
}
f()
x
```

If `<<-` doesn't find an existing variable, it will create one in the global environment. This is usually undesirable, because global variables introduce non-obvious dependencies between functions. `<<-` is most often used in conjunction with a closure, as described in [Closures](#closures).

There are two other special types of binding, delayed and active:

*   Rather than assigning the result of an expression immediately, a 
    __delayed binding__ creates and stores a promise to evaluate the expression
    when needed. We can create delayed bindings with the `env_bind_exprs()`.

    ```{r, cache = TRUE}
    env_bind_exprs(current_env(), b = {Sys.sleep(1); 1})
    
    system.time(print(b))
    system.time(print(b))
    ```

    Delayed bindings are used to implement `autoload()`, which makes R behave 
    as if the package data is in memory, even though it's only loaded from 
    disk when you ask for it.
    \index{bindings!delayed}
  
*   __Active__ are not bound to a constant object. Instead, they're re-computed
    every time they're accessed:

    ```{r}
    current_env() %>% env_bind_fns(z = function() runif(1))
    
    z
    z
    ```

    You may 
    want to use this function directly if you want more control. Active 
    bindings are used to implement reference class fields.
    \index{bindings!active}

### Exercises

1.  List three ways in which an environment differs from a list.

1.  Create an environment as illustrated by this picture.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/recursive-1.png", dpi = 300)
    ```

1.  Create a pair of environment as illustrated by this picture.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/recursive-2.png", dpi = 300)
    ```

1.  Using `env_parent()` and a loop (or a recursive function), verify that the 
    ancestors of `global_env()` include `base_env()` and `empty_env()`. Use the 
    same basic idea to implement your own version of `search()`.


1.  What does this function do? How does it differ from `<<-` and why
    might you prefer it?
    
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    rebind <- function(name, value, env = parent.frame()) {
      if (identical(env, emptyenv())) {
        stop("Can't find ", name, call. = FALSE)
      } else if (exists(name, envir = env, inherits = FALSE)) {
        assign(name, value, envir = env)
      } else {
        rebind(name, value, parent.env(env))
      }
    }
    rebind("a", 10)
    a <- 5
    rebind("a", 10)
    a
    ```

1.  Create a version of `env_bind()` that will only bind new names, never 
    re-bind old names. Some programming languages only do this, and are known 
    as [single assignment languages][single assignment].

1.  Write an assignment function that can do active, delayed, and locked 
    bindings. What might you call it? What arguments should it take? Can you 
    guess which sort of assignment it should do based on the input?



## Recursing over environments {#env-recursion}
\index{recursion!over environments}

If you want to operate on every ancestor of an environment, it's often convenient to write a recursive function. This section shows you how by applying your new knowledge of environments to write a function that given a name, finds the environment `where()` that name is defined, using R's regular scoping rules. 

The definition of `where()` is straightforward. It has two arguments: the name to look for (as a string), and the environment in which to start the search. (We'll learn why `caller_env()` is a good default in [calling environments](#calling-environments).)

```{r}
where <- function(name, env = caller_env()) {
  if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
    # Base case
    stop("Can't find ", name, call. = FALSE)
  } else if (env_has(env, name)) {
    # Success case
    env
  } else {
    # Recursive case
    where(name, env_parent(env))
  }
}
```

There are three cases:

* The base case: we've reached the empty environment and haven't found the
  binding. We can't go any further, so we throw an error. 

* The successful case: the name exists in this environment, so we return the
  environment.

* The recursive case: the name was not found in this environment, so try the 
  parent.

These three cases are illustrated with these three examples:

```{r, error = TRUE}
where("yyy")

x <- 5
where("x")

where("mean")
```

It might help to see a picture. Imagine you have two environments, as in the following code and diagram:

```{r}
e4a <- env(empty_env(), a = 1, b = 2)
e4b <- env(e4a, x = 10, a = 11)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/where-ex.png", dpi = 300)
```

* `where(a, e4a)` will find `a` in `e4a`.

* `where("b", e4a)` doesn't find `b` in `e4a`, so it looks in its parent, `e4b`,
  and finds it there.

* `where("c", e4a)` looks in `e4a`, then `e4b`, then hits the empty environment
  and throws an error.

It's natural to work with environments recursively, so `where()` provides a useful template. Removing the specifics of `where()` shows the structure more clearly:

```{r}
f <- function(..., env = caller_env()) {
  if (identical(env, empty_env())) {
    # base case
  } else if (success) {
    # success case
  } else {
    # recursive case
    f(..., env = env_parent(env))
  }
}
```

::: sidebar

### Iteration vs recursion {-}

It's possible to use a loop instead of recursion. This might run slightly faster (because we eliminate some function calls), but I think it's harder to understand. I include it because you might find it easier to see what's happening if you're less familiar with recursive functions.

```{r}
f2 <- function(..., env = caller_env()) {
  while (!identical(env, empty_env())) {
    if (success) {
      # success case
      return()
    }
    # inspect parent
    env <- env_parent(env)
  }

  # base case
}
```

:::

### Exercises

1.  Modify `where()` to return _all_ environments that contain a binding for
    `name`.

1.  Write your own version of `env_get()` using a function written in the style 
    of `where()`.

1.  Write a function called `fget()` that finds only function objects. It 
    should have two arguments, `name` and `env`, and should obey the regular 
    scoping rules for functions: if there's an object with a matching name 
    that's not a function, look in the parent. For an added challenge, also 
    add an `inherits` argument which controls whether the function recurses up 
    the parents or only looks in one environment.

## Special environments {#function-envs}
\index{functions!environments}
 
Most environments are not created by you with `env()` but are created by R. 

* The __global__ environment.

* The __function__ environment is the environment where the function was created. 
  Just like environments, every function has exactly one parent environment. 
  This defines R's lexical scoping rules. 
  
* Every time you run the function, it creates an __execution__ environment, 
  a child of the parent environment. This stores variables created during 
  execution and is usually ephemeral.

Finally we'll finish off with a discussion of __package__ environments and __namespaces__.

### The global environment

The `global_env()`, or global environment, is the interactive workspace. This is the environment in which you normally work:

```{r}
current_env()
```

R prints this as `R_GlobalEnv`, and you can access anywhere with `global_env()`.

### The function environment
\index{environments!function}

During creation, a function captures the current environment. This is called the __function environment__, and is used for lexical scoping. You can get the function environment with `fn_env()`: 

```{r}
y <- 1
f <- function(x) x + y
fn_env(f)
```

::: base 
Use `environment(f)` to access the environment of function `f`.
:::

In diagrams, I'll depict functions as rectangles with a rounded end that holds the reference to the environment.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/binding.png", dpi = 300)
```

In this case the parent of `f` is the same environment that defines its name. But that's not always true: in the following code `g` is bound in a new environment `e`, but its parent will still be the global environment. This distinction is important to making namespaces work, as described below.

```{r}
e <- env()
e$g <- function() 1
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/binding-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Execution environments

What will the following function return the first time it's run? What about the second? \index{environments!execution}

```{r}
g <- function(x) {
  if (!env_has(current_env(), "a")) {
    message("Defining a")
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a
}
```

Think about it for a moment before you read on.

```{r}
g(10)
g(10)
```

This function returns the same value every time because of the fresh start principle, described in [a fresh start](#fresh-start). Each time a function is called, a new environment is created to host execution. The parent of the execution environment is the enclosing environment of the function. Once the function has completed, this environment is thrown away.

Let's draw that the process out with a simpler function. You can tell an environment is an execution environment because the parent arrow goes via the function environment.

```{r}
h <- function(x) {
  # 1.
  a <- 2 # 2.
  x + a
}
y <- h(1) # 3.
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/execution.png", dpi = 300)
```

When you return a function from another function, the parent environment of the child function is the execution environment of the parent. This means that the execution environment is no longer ephemeral.

\index{closures|environment}
The following example illustrates that idea with a function factory, `plus()`. We use that factory to create a function called `plus_one()`. There's a lot going on in the diagram because the enclosing environment of `plus_one()` is the execution environment of `plus()`. 

```{r}
plus <- function(x) {
  function(y) x + y
}
plus_one <- plus(1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/closure.png", dpi = 300)
```

You'll learn more about function factories in [functional programming](#functional-programming).


### Package environments

* The `base_env()`, or base environment, is the environment of the base package.
  Its parent is the empty environment.

The parent of the global environment changes every time you load a package.

[Draw a diagram]{.todo}

Almost every R session also has packages, and each package has its own environment. You can see these with `search()`, which lists all parents of the global environment. This is called the search path because objects in these environments can be found from the top-level interactive workspace. The search path contains one environment for each attached package and any other objects that you've `attach()`ed. It also contains a special environment called `Autoloads` which is used to save memory by only loading package objects (like big datasets) when needed. \indexc{search()}

[Use `search_envs()`]{.todo}

```{r}
search()

pkg_env("stats")
```

The `global_env()`, the `base_env()`, the search-path environments, and the `emptyenv()` are connected as shown below. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/search-path.png", dpi = 300)
```

Each time you load a new package with `library()` it is inserted between the global environment and the package that was previously at the top of the search path.

Namespaces, which ensure that package code finds function as desired by the function author, adds an additional wrinkle which we'll discuss in [Namespaces].

### Namespaces

The distinction between the binding environment and the enclosing environment is important for package namespaces. Package namespaces keep packages independent. For example, if package A uses the base `mean()` function, what happens if package B creates its own `mean()` function? Namespaces ensure that package A continues to use the base `mean()` function, and that package A is not affected by package B (unless explicitly asked for). \index{namespaces}

Namespaces are implemented using environments, taking advantage of the fact that functions don't have to live in their enclosing environments. For example, take the base function `sd()`. Its enclosing and binding environments are different:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# enclosing = where sd() finds values, such as mean() or var()
get_env(sd)
#> <environment: namespace:stats>

# binding = where we can find sd()
where("sd")
#> <environment: package:stats>
```

The definition of `sd()` uses `var()`, but if we make our own version of `var()` it doesn't affect `sd()`:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
sd(x)
var <- function(x, na.rm = TRUE) 100
sd(x)
```

This works because every package has two environments associated with it: the _package_ environment and the _namespace_ environment. The package environment contains every publicly accessible function, and is placed on the search path. The namespace environment contains all functions (including internal functions), and its parent environment is a special imports environment that contains bindings to all the functions that the package needs. Every exported function in a package is bound into the _package_ environment, but enclosed by the _namespace_ environment. This complicated relationship is illustrated by the following diagram:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/namespace.png", dpi = 300)
```

When we type `var` into the console, it's found first in the global environment. When `sd()` looks for `var()` it finds it first in its namespace environment so never looks in the `globalenv()`.

## Frames and the call stack

The frame, aka evaluation context. 

Every frame has a parent (another frame), and an environemnt. https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/d1109cfit occ97e1179668736ab36beb0d1a89e787a87/src/include/Defn.h#L524. (Note that `?environment` uses different sense of frame, which comes from S.)

The environment associated with a frame is usually an execution environment of a function (but can be an environment supplied to `eval()` or `global_env()`).

Frames are not explicitly reified in base R. You can only inspect their properties using the sys functions. There's no other way to inspect or manipulate. Not exposed in C API. (So can't give quosure treatment.)

Looking up variables in the calling stack rather than in the enclosing environment is called __dynamic scoping__. Few languages implement dynamic scoping (Emacs Lisp is a [notable exception](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html#SEC15).) This is because dynamic scoping makes it much harder to reason about how a function operates: not only do you need to know how it was defined, you also need to know in what context it was called. Dynamic scoping is primarily useful for developing functions that aid interactive data analysis. It is one of the topics discussed in [non-standard evaluation](#nse). \index{scoping!dynamic} \index{dynamic scoping}

### Calling environment {#calling-environments}

The __caller__ environment is the environment from which the function is 
  called. In a sense, the caller environment has two parents: the parent
  environment, and the caller of the caller.

Look at the following code. What do you expect `i()` to return when the code is run? \index{environments|calling}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
h <- function() {
  x <- 10
  function() {
    x
  }
}
i <- h()
x <- 20
i()
```

The top-level `x` (bound to 20) is a red herring: using the regular scoping rules, `h()` looks first where it is defined and finds that the value associated with `x` is 10. However, it's still meaningful to ask what value `x` is associated with in the environment where `i()` is called: `x` is 10 in the environment where `h()` is defined, but it is 20 in the environment where `h()` is called.

We can access this environment with `caller_env()`. This function returns the __environment__ where the function was called. We can also use this function to look up the value of names in that environment:

```{r}
f2 <- function() {
  x <- 10
  function() {
    def <- env_get(current_env(), "x", inherit = TRUE)
    cll <- env_get(caller_env(), "x")
    list(defined = def, called = cll)
  }
}
g2 <- f2()
x <- 20
str(g2())
```

In more complicated scenarios, there's not just one parent call, but a sequence of calls which lead all the way back to the initiating function, called from the top-level.  The following code generates a call stack three levels deep. The open-ended arrows represent the calling environment of each execution environment. 

```{r}
x <- 0
y <- 10
f <- function() {
  x <- 1
  g()
}
g <- function() {
  x <- 2
  h()
}
h <- function() {
  x <- 3
  x + y
}
f()
```

<!-- Jenny: Should an arrow connecting an execution environment to its calling environment point the other way, i.e. arrow points from execution *to* the parent? I worked a version of the example where I actually print all these environments. Arrow pointing from execution env and to calling better reflects how you can actually determine these relationships. Shouldn't `f()` also have a calling environment = global environment?

To get the most out of this example, I also assigned different values to `y` inside `f()` and `g()`. The fact that `h()` will use its own value of `x` seems pretty obvious. What's more interesting is that `h()` will look to its enclosing environment (global env) for `y` and not its direct or indirect calling environments. It's really easy to think the wrong way about that, since most of the time people play with examples where enclosing and calling are both global env.

Other than triggering execution, what "good" is the calling environment to the callee? Or, rather, what effect does it have on the callee? Under regular scoping, it doesn't feel like there is anything? When I finished this chapter, I realized I still couldn't say much about the role of calling env.-->


### Exercises

1.  List the four environments associated with a function. What does each one
    do? Why is the distinction between enclosing and binding environments
    particularly important?
    
1.  Draw a diagram that shows the enclosing environments of this function:
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f1 <- function(x1) {
      f2 <- function(x2) {
        f3 <- function(x3) {
          x1 + x2 + x3
        }
        f3(3)
      }
      f2(2)
    }
    f1(1)
    ```
    
1.  Expand your previous diagram to show function bindings.

1.  Expand it again to show the execution and calling environments.

1.  Write an enhanced version of `str()` that provides more information 
    about functions. Show where the function was found and what environment 
    it was defined in.

<!-- Jenny: I don't see how to do the "draw a diagram" exercise in 3 separate steps: [1] enclosing, then [2] binding, then [3] execution & calling environments. Because 2 of the 3 enclosing environments *are* execution environments.-->


## Explicit environments {#explicit-envs}

As well as powering scoping, environments are also useful data structures in their own right because they have __reference semantics__.  Unlike most objects in R, when you modify an environment, it does not make a copy. For example, look at this `modify()` function. \index{copy-on-modify!exceptions} \index{reference semantics}

```{r}
modify <- function(x) {
  x$a <- 2
  invisible()
}
```

If you apply it to a list, the original list is not changed because modifying a list actually creates and modifies a copy.

```{r}
x_l <- list()
x_l$a <- 1
modify(x_l)
x_l$a
```

However, if you apply it to an environment, the original environment _is_ modified:

```{r}
x_e <- new.env()
x_e$a <- 1
modify(x_e)
x_e$a
```

Just as you can use a list to pass data between functions, you can also use an environment. When creating your own environment, note that you should set its parent environment to be the empty environment. This ensures you don't accidentally inherit objects from somewhere else:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- 1
e1 <- new.env()
get("x", envir = e1)

e2 <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())
get("x", envir = e2)
```

Environments are data structures useful for solving three common problems:

* Avoiding copies of large data.
* Managing state within a package.
* Efficiently looking up values from names.

These are described in turn below.

### Avoiding copies

Since environments have reference semantics, you'll never accidentally create a copy. This makes it a useful vessel for large objects. It's a common technique for bioconductor packages which often have to manage large genomic objects. Changes to R 3.1.0 have made this use substantially less important because modifying a list no longer makes a deep copy. Previously, modifying a single element of a list would cause every element to be copied, an expensive operation if some elements are large. Now, modifying a list efficiently reuses existing vectors, saving much time.

### Package state

Explicit environments are useful in packages because they allow you to maintain state across function calls. Normally, objects in a package are locked, so you can't modify them directly. Instead, you can do something like this:

```{r}
my_env <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())
my_env$a <- 1

get_a <- function() {
  my_env$a
}
set_a <- function(value) {
  old <- my_env$a
  my_env$a <- value
  invisible(old)
}
```

Returning the old value from setter functions is a good pattern because it makes it easier to reset the previous value in conjunction with `on.exit()` (see more in [on exit](#on-exit)).

### As a hashmap

A hashmap is a data structure that takes constant, O(1), time to find an object based on its name. Environments provide this behaviour by default, so can be used to simulate a hashmap. See the CRAN package `hash` for a complete development of this idea. \index{hashmaps} \index{dictionaries}

## Quiz answers {#env-answers}

1.  There are four ways: every object in an environment must have a name;
    order doesn't matter; environments have parents; environments have
    reference semantics.
   
1.  The parent of the global environment is the last package that you
    loaded. The only environment that doesn't have a parent is the empty
    environment.
    
1.  The enclosing environment of a function is the environment where it
    was created. It determines where a function looks for variables.
    
1.  Use `parent.frame()`.

1.  `<-` always creates a binding in the current environment; `<<-`
    rebinds an existing name in a parent of the current environment.
