# Preface

Welcome to the work-in-progress 2nd edition of advanced R. This preface describes the major changes that I have made to the book.

Colour.

## rlang

A big change since the first edition of the book is the creation of the rlang package. This goal of this package is to provide clean APIs for R internals. We use this package in favour of the base R APIs where it is applicable. I strongly believe this makes easier to understand how the R language works, because you can focus your cognitive energies on learning the fundamentals, rather than struggling with the incidentals of functions that evolved organgical over many years.

Overall, rlang is also a work in progress. And much of the API continues to mature. However, the code used in this book is part of the rlang's testing process and will continue to work in the future.

In each section, I'll also briefly outline the base R equivalents to rlang code. But if you want to see the purest base R expression of these ideas, I recommend reading the first edition of the book, which you can find online at ...

## Foundations

*  Environments: more pictures. Much improved discussion of frames and how they
   relate to the call stack.

## Programming paradigms

The meat of the book is now organised around the three most important programming paradigms in R:

* Functional programming has been updated to focus on the tools provided by
  the purrr package. The greatear consistency in the purrr package makes 
  it possible focus more on the underlying ideas without being distracted by 
  incidental details.

* Object oriented programming (OOP) now forms a major section of the book with 
  individual chapters on base types, S3, S4, R6, and the tradeoffs between 
  the systems.
  
* Metaprogramming, formerly computing on the language, describes the suite
  of tools that you can use to generate code with code. Compared to the 
  first edition has been substantially expanded (from three chapters to five)
  and reorganised. More diagrams.

## Removals

* Chapter of base R vocabulary was removed.

* The style guide has moved to http://style.tidyverse.org/. It is now
  paired with the [styler](http://styler.r-lib.org/) package which can
  automatically apply many of the rules.

* R's C interface moving to the work-in-progress
