# Preface

Welcome to the 2nd edition of __Advanced R__! The goal of this update was threefold: improve coverage of important concepts that I fully understood only after the publication of the first edition, reduce coverage of topics time has shown to be less useful, and generally make it easier to understand with better text, clearer code examples, and many more diagrams. If you've already familiar with the 1st edition, I described the major changes below so that you can focus your reading on the new areas (but I really do encourage you to skim throughout the book).

If you're reading a printed version of this book you'll notice one big change very quickly: Advanced R is now in colour! This considerably improved the syntax highlighting of code chunks, and made it much easier to create helpful diagrams. I have taken advantage of this and included over 100 new diagrams throughout the book.

Another big change in this version is the use of packages, particularly [rlang](http://rlang.r-lib.org), which provides a clean interface to low-level data structures and operations. The first edition used base R functions almost exclusively, which created some pedagogical challenges because many functions evolved independently over multiple years, making it hard to see the big underlying ideas hidden amongst the incidental variations in function names and arguments. I continue to show base equivalents in sidebars, footnotes, and where needed in individual sections, but if you want to see the purest base R expression of these ideas, I recommend reading the first edition of the book, which you can find online at <http://adv-r.had.co.nz>.

By and large the second edition has considerably expanded coverage of existing material. There were, however, four chapters that have been removed:

* The vocabulary chapter was removed. It was always a bit of an odd duck, and
  think there are more effective ways to present vocabulary lists than a book
  chapter.

* The style chapter has been replaced with an online style guide available
  at <http://style.tidyverse.org/>. The style guide is paired with the new
  [styler][styler] package which can automatically apply many of the rules.

* The chapter of R's C interface has been moved to a new repo that will aim
  to provide more a comprehensive description of writing C code to work with
  R data structures: <https://github.com/hadley/r-internals>. This is still
  a work in progress.

* The memory chapter has been removed. Much of the material has been integrated
  into Chapter \@ref(names-values). The remainder felt excessively technical
  and not that important to understand, so has been removed.

The foundations of R have not changed in the five years since the publication of the first edition, but my understanding of them certainly has. Thus, the overall structure of "Foundations" has remained roughly the same, but many of the individual chapters have been considerably improved:

*   Chapter \@ref(names-values), "Names and values", is a brand new chapter 
    that helps you understand the difference between objects and names of 
    objects. This helps you more accurately predict when R will make a copy of 
    a data structure, and lays important groundwork to understand functional 
    programming.

*   Chapter \@ref(vectors-chap), "Vectors", was previously called data 
    structures, and has been rewritten to focus on vector types like integers,
    factors, and data frames. It contains more details of important S3
    vectors (like dates and date-times), and discusses the data frame variation
    provided by the [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org) package.

*   Chapter \@ref(subsetting), "Subsetting", now distinguishes between `[` and
    `[[` by their intention: `[` extracts many values and `[[` extracts a 
    single value (previously they were characterised by whether they "simplified"
    or "preserved"). Section \@ref(subset-single) draws the "train" to help you
    understand how `[[` works with lists, and introduces the new 
    `purrr::pluck()` and `purrr::chuck()` functions that provide more consistent 
    behaviour for out-of-bounds indices.

*   Chapter \@ref(functions), "Functions", has an improved ordering,
    now introduces the pipe as a third way to compose functions (Section 
    \@ref(function-composition)), and has considerably improved coverage of 
    function forms (Section \@ref(function-forms)).

*   Chapter \@ref(environments), "Environments", has a reorganised treatment of
    special environments (Section \@ref(function-envs)), and a much improved 
    discussion of the call stack (Section \@ref(call-stack)).

*   Chapter \@ref(conditions), "Conditions", contains material previously 
    in "Exceptions and debugging", and much new content on how R's condition
    system works. It also shows you how to create your own custom conditions,
    which make testing errors easier, and we are starting to use through the
    tidyverse.

The chapters following foundations have been re-organised around the three most important programming paradigms in R: functional programming, object oriented programming, and metaprogramming.

* Functional programming is now more cleanly divided in to the three main 
  FP techniques: "Functionals" (Chapter \@ref(functionals)), "Function 
  factories" (Chapter \@ref(function-factories)), and "Function operators"
  (Chapter \@ref(function-operators)). I've tried to focus on ideas that have
  practical applications in data science, and reduce the amount of pure theory
  that lacks practical benefits. 
  
  To this end, these chapters now use functions provided by the purrr package, 
  which allows me to focus more on the underlying and less on the incidental 
  variations. This lead to a considerable simplification of description of
  function operators since a major use was to work around the absence of `...`
  in base functionals.
  
* Object oriented programming (OOP) now forms a major section of the book with 
  completely new chapters on base types (Chapter \@ref(base-types)), 
  S3 (Chapter \@ref(s3)), S4 (Chapter \@ref(s4)), R6 (Chapter \@ref(R6)), 
  and the tradeoffs between the systems (Chapter \@ref(oo-tradeoffs)).
  Unfortunately, these chapters focus on how the different object systems work, 
  not how to use them effectively. Many of the technical details are not 
  described elsewhere, and effective use of OO really needs a book of its own.
  
* Metaprogramming, formerly "computing on the language", describes the suite
  of tools that you can use to generate code with code. Compared to the 1st 
  edition this material has been substantially expanded and now focusses on
  "tidy evaluation", a set of ideas and theory that that make metaprogramming 
  safe, well-principled, and accessible to many more R programmers. 
  Chapter \@ref(expressions), "Expressions", describes the underlying data 
  structures; Chapter \@ref(quasiquotation), "Quasiquotation", quoting and 
  unquoting; Chapter \@ref(evaluation), "Evaluation", evaluating code in 
  special environments; and Chapter \@ref(translation), "Translations", pulls 
  all the themes together to show how you might translate from one 
  (programming) language to another.

### Techniques

The final section of the book collects chapters on programming techniques, including debugging, profiling, improving performance, and connecting R and C++.
