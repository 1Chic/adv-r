# Preface

Welcome to the work-in-progress 2nd edition of advanced R. This preface describes the major changes that I have made to the book.

## Programming paradigms

The meat of the book is now organised around the three most important programming paradigms in R:

* Functional programming has been updated to focus on the tools provided by
  the purrr package. The greatear consistency in the purrr package makes 
  it possible focus more on the underlying ideas without being distracted by 
  incidental details.

* Object oriented programming (OOP) now forms a major section of the book with 
  individual chapters on base types, S3, S4, R6, and the tradeoffs between 
  the systems.
  
* Metaprogramming, formerly computing on the language, describes the suite
  of tools that you can use to generate code with code. Compared to the 
  first edition has been substantially expanded (from three chapters to five)
  and reorganised. More diagrams.

## Removals

* Chapter of base R vocabulary was removed.

* The style guide has moved to http://style.tidyverse.org/. It is now
  paired with the [styler](http://styler.r-lib.org/) package which can
  automatically apply many of the rules.

* R's C interface moving to the work-in-progress
